    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. AT ZATON&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marked cards!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a score round us when the fool, little knowing the man with
      whom he had to deal, and as little how to lose like a gentleman, flung the
      words in my teeth. He thought, I&rsquo;ll be sworn, that I should storm and
      swear and ruffle it like any common cock of the hackle. But that was never
      Gil de Berault&rsquo;s way. For a few seconds after he had spoken I did not even
      look at him. I passed my eye instead&mdash;smiling, BIEN ENTENDU&mdash;round
      the ring of waiting faces, saw that there was no one except De Pombal I
      had cause to fear; and then at last I rose and looked at the fool with the
      grim face I have known impose on older and wiser men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marked cards, M. l&rsquo;Anglais?&rsquo; I said, with a chilling sneer. &lsquo;They are
      used, I am told, to trap players&mdash;not unbirched schoolboys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet I say that they are marked!&rsquo; he replied hotly, in his queer foreign
      jargon. &lsquo;In my last hand I had nothing. You doubled the stakes. Bah, sir,
      you knew! You have swindled me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur is easy to swindle&mdash;when he plays with a mirror behind
      him,&rsquo; I answered tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that there was a great roar of laughter, which might have been heard in
      the street, and which brought to the table everyone in the eating-house
      whom his voice had not already attracted. But I did not relax my face. I
      waited until all was quiet again, and then waving aside two or three who
      stood between us and the entrance, I pointed gravely to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a little space behind the church of St Jacques, M. l&rsquo;Etranger,&rsquo; 
      I said, putting on my hat and taking my cloak on my arm. &lsquo;Doubtless you
      will accompany me thither?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched up his hat, his face burning with shame and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure!&rsquo; he blurted out. &lsquo;To the devil, if you like!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought the matter arranged, when the Marquis laid his hand on the young
      fellow&rsquo;s arm and checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This must not be,&rsquo; he said, turning from him to me with his grand,
      fine-gentleman&rsquo;s air. &lsquo;You know me, M. de Berault. This matter has gone
      far enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too far! M. de Pombal,&rsquo; I answered bitterly. &lsquo;Still, if you wish to take
      your friend&rsquo;s place, I shall raise no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chut, man!&rsquo; he retorted, shrugging his shoulders negligently. &lsquo;I know
      you, and I do not fight with men of your stamp. Nor need this gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly,&rsquo; I replied, bowing low, &lsquo;if he prefers to be caned in the
      streets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That stung the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a care! have a care!&rsquo; he cried hotly. &lsquo;You go too far, M. Berault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;De Berault, if you please,&rsquo; I objected, eyeing him sternly. &lsquo;My family
      has borne the DE as long as yours, M. de Pombal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not deny that, and he answered, &lsquo;As you please;&rsquo; at the same time
      restraining his friend by a gesture. &lsquo;But none the less,&rsquo; he continued,
      &lsquo;take my advice. The Cardinal has forbidden duelling, and this time he
      means it! You have been in trouble once and gone free. A second time it
      may fare worse with you. Let this gentleman go, therefore, M. de Berault.
      Besides&mdash;why, shame upon you, man!&rsquo; he exclaimed hotly; &lsquo;he is but a
      lad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three who stood behind me applauded that, But I turned and they met
      my eye; and they were as mum as mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His age is his own concern,&rsquo; I said grimly. &lsquo;He was old enough a while
      ago to insult me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I will prove my words!&rsquo; the lad cried, exploding at last. He had
      spirit enough, and the Marquis had had hard work to restrain him so long.
      &lsquo;You do me no service, M. de Pombal,&rsquo; he continued, pettishly shaking off
      his friend&rsquo;s hand. &lsquo;By your leave, this gentleman and I will settle this
      matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is better,&rsquo; I said, nodding drily, while the Marquis stood aside,
      frowning and baffled. &lsquo;Permit me to lead the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Zaton&rsquo;s eating-house stands scarcely a hundred paces from St Jacques la
      Boucherie, and half the company went thither with us. The evening was wet,
      the light in the streets was waning, the streets themselves were dirty and
      slippery. There were few passers in the Rue St Antoine; and our party,
      which earlier in the day must have attracted notice and a crowd, crossed
      unmarked, and entered without interruption the paved triangle which lies
      immediately behind the church. I saw in the distance one of the Cardinal&rsquo;s
      guard loitering in front of the scaffolding round the new Hotel Richelieu;
      and the sight of the uniform gave me pause for a moment. But it was too
      late to repent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman began at once to strip off his clothes. I closed mine to
      the throat, for the air was chilly. At that moment, while we stood
      preparing, and most of the company seemed a little inclined to stand off
      from me, I felt a hand on my arm, and turning, saw the dwarfish tailor at
      whose house, in the Rue Savonnerie, I lodged at the time. The fellow&rsquo;s
      presence was unwelcome, to say the least of it; and though for want of
      better company I had sometimes encouraged him to be free with me at home,
      I took that to be no reason why I should be plagued with him before
      gentlemen. I shook him off, therefore, hoping by a frown to silence him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to be so easily put down, however, and perforce I had to speak
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afterwards, afterwards,&rsquo; I said hurriedly. &lsquo;I am engaged now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t, sir!&rsquo; the poor fool cried, clinging to my sleeve.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it! You will bring a curse on the house. He is but a lad, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, too!&rsquo; I exclaimed, losing patience. &lsquo;Be silent, you scum! What do
      you know about gentlemen&rsquo;s quarrels? Leave me; do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the Cardinal!&rsquo; he cried in a quavering voice. &lsquo;The Cardinal, M. de
      Berault! The last man you killed is not forgotten yet. This time he will
      be sure to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave me, do you hear?&rsquo; I hissed. The fellow&rsquo;s impudence passed all
      bounds. It was as bad as his croaking. &lsquo;Begone!&rsquo; I added. &lsquo;I suppose you
      are afraid that he will kill me, and you will lose your money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Frison fell back at that almost as if I had struck him, and I turned to my
      adversary, who had been awaiting my motions with impatience. God knows he
      did look young as he stood with his head bare and his fair hair drooping
      over his smooth woman&rsquo;s forehead&mdash;a mere lad fresh from the college
      of Burgundy, if they have such a thing in England. I felt a sudden chill
      as I looked at him: a qualm, a tremor, a presentiment. What was it the
      little tailor had said? That I should&mdash;but there, he did not know.
      What did he know of such things? If I let this pass I must kill a man a
      day, or leave Paris and the eating-house, and starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thousand pardons,&rsquo; I said gravely, as I drew and took my place. &lsquo;A dun.
      I am sorry that the poor devil caught me so inopportunely. Now however, I
      am at your service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He saluted and we crossed swords and began. But from the first I had no
      doubt what the result would be. The slippery stones and fading light gave
      him, it is true, some chance, some advantage, more than he deserved; but I
      had no sooner felt his blade than I knew that he was no swordsman.
      Possibly he had taken half-a-dozen lessons in rapier art, and practised
      what he learned with an Englishman as heavy and awkward as himself. But
      that was all. He made a few wild clumsy rushes, parrying widely. When I
      had foiled these, the danger was over, and I held him at my mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I played with him a little while, watching the sweat gather on his brow
      and the shadow of the church tower fall deeper and darker, like the shadow
      of doom, on his face. Not out of cruelty&mdash;God knows I have never
      erred in that direction!&mdash;but because, for the first time in my life,
      I felt a strange reluctance to strike the blow. The curls clung to his
      forehead; his breath came and went in gasps; I heard the men behind me and
      one or two of them drop an oath; and then I slipped&mdash;slipped, and was
      down in a moment on my right side, my elbow striking the pavement so
      sharply that the arm grew numb to the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held off. I heard a dozen voices cry, &lsquo;Now! now you have him!&rsquo; But he
      held off. He stood back and waited with his breast heaving and his point
      lowered, until I had risen and stood again on my guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough! enough!&rsquo; a rough voice behind me cried. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt the man after
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On guard, sir!&rsquo; I answered coldly&mdash;for he seemed to waver, and be in
      doubt. &lsquo;It was an accident. It shall not avail you again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Several voices cried &lsquo;Shame!&rsquo; and one, &lsquo;You coward!&rsquo; But the Englishman
      stepped forward, a fixed look in his blue eyes. He took his place without
      a word. I read in his drawn white face that he had made up his mind to the
      worst, and his courage so won my admiration that I would gladly and
      thankfully have set one of the lookers-on&mdash;any of the lookers-on&mdash;in
      his place; but that could not be. So I thought of Zaton&rsquo;s closed to me, of
      Pombal&rsquo;s insult, of the sneers and slights I had long kept at the sword&rsquo;s
      point; and, pressing him suddenly in a heat of affected anger, I thrust
      strongly over his guard, which had grown feeble, and ran him through the
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I saw him lying, laid out on the stones with his eyes half shut, and
      his face glimmering white in the dusk&mdash;not that I saw him thus long,
      for there were a dozen kneeling round him in a twinkling&mdash;I felt an
      unwonted pang. It passed, however, in a moment. For I found myself
      confronted by a ring of angry faces&mdash;of men who, keeping at a
      distance, hissed and cursed and threatened me, calling me Black Death and
      the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were mostly canaille, who had gathered during the fight, and had
      viewed all that passed from the farther side of the railings. While some
      snarled and raged at me like wolves, calling me &lsquo;Butcher!&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Cut-throat!&rsquo; or cried out that Berault was at his trade again, others
      threatened me with the vengeance of the Cardinal, flung the edict in my
      teeth, and said with glee that the guard were coming&mdash;they would see
      me hanged yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His blood is on your head!&rsquo; one cried furiously. &lsquo;He will be dead in an
      hour. And you will swing for him! Hurrah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Begone,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, to Montfaucon,&rsquo; he answered, mocking me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; to your kennel!&rsquo; I replied, with a look which sent him a yard
      backwards, though the railings were between us. And I wiped my blade
      carefully, standing a little apart. For&mdash;well, I could understand it&mdash;it
      was one of those moments when a man is not popular. Those who had come
      with me from the eating-house eyed me askance, and turned their backs when
      I drew nearer; and those who had joined us and obtained admission were
      scarcely more polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not to be outdone in SANG FROID. I cocked my hat, and drawing my
      cloak over my shoulders, went out with a swagger which drove the curs from
      the gate before I came within a dozen paces of it. The rascals outside
      fell back as quickly, and in a moment I was in the street. Another moment
      and I should have been clear of the place and free to lie by for a while&mdash;when,
      without warning, a scurry took place round me. The crowd fled every way
      into the gloom, and in a hand-turn a dozen of the Cardinal&rsquo;s guards closed
      round me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had some acquaintance with the officer in command, and he saluted me
      civilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a bad business, M. de Berault,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The man is dead they
      tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither dying nor dead,&rsquo; I answered lightly. &lsquo;If that be all you may go
      home again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With you,&rsquo; he replied, with a grin, &lsquo;certainly. And as it rains, the
      sooner the better. I must ask you for your sword, I am afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take it,&rsquo; I said, with the philosophy which never deserts me. &lsquo;But the
      man will not die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope that may avail you,&rsquo; he answered in a tone I did not like. &lsquo;Left
      wheel, my friends! To the Chatelet! March!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are worse places,&rsquo; I said, and resigned myself to fate. After all,
      I had been in a prison before, and learned that only one jail lets no
      prisoner escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I found that my friend&rsquo;s orders were to hand me over to the
      watch, and that I was to be confined like any common jail-bird caught
      cutting a purse or slitting a throat, I confess my heart sank. If I could
      get speech with the Cardinal, all would probably be well; but if I failed
      in this, or if the case came before him in strange guise, or if he were in
      a hard mood himself, then it might go ill with me. The edict said, death!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the lieutenant at the Chatelet did not put himself to much trouble to
      hearten me. &lsquo;What! again M. de Berault?&rsquo; he said, raising his eyebrows as
      he received me at the gate, and recognised me by the light of the brazier
      which his men were just kindling outside. &lsquo;You are a very bold man, or a
      very foolhardy one, to come here again. The old business, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but he is not dead,&rsquo; I answered coolly. &lsquo;He has a trifle&mdash;a
      mere scratch. It was behind the church of St Jacques.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He looked dead enough, my friend,&rsquo; the guardsman interposed. He had not
      yet left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; I answered scornfully. &lsquo;Have you ever known me make a mistake When
      I kill a man I kill him. I put myself to pains, I tell you, not to kill
      this Englishman. Therefore he will live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; the lieutenant said, with a dry smile. &lsquo;And you had better
      hope so, too, M. de Berault, For if not&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I said, somewhat troubled. &lsquo;If not, what, my friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear he will be the last man you will fight,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;And even if
      he lives, I would not be too sure, my friend. This time the Cardinal is
      determined to put it down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He and I are old friends,&rsquo; I said confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I have heard,&rsquo; he answered, with a short laugh. &lsquo;I think that the same
      was said of Chalais. I do not remember that it saved his head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not reassuring. But worse was to come. Early in the morning
      orders were received that I should be treated with especial strictness,
      and I was given the choice between irons and one of the cells below the
      level. Choosing the latter, I was left to reflect upon many things; among
      others, on the queer and uncertain nature of the Cardinal, who loved, I
      knew, to play with a man as a cat with a mouse; and on the ill effects
      which sometimes attend a high chest-thrust however carefully delivered. I
      only rescued myself at last from these and other unpleasant reflections by
      obtaining the loan of a pair of dice; and the light being just enough to
      enable me to reckon the throws, I amused myself for hours by casting them
      on certain principles of my own. But a long run again and again upset my
      calculations; and at last brought me to the conclusion that a run of bad
      luck may be so persistent as to see out the most sagacious player. This
      was not a reflection very welcome to me at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, for three days it was all the company I had. At the end of
      that time, the knave of a jailor who attended me, and who had never grown
      tired of telling me, after the fashion of his kind, that I should be
      hanged, came to me with a less assured air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you would like a little water?&rsquo; he said civilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, rascal?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To wash with,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked for some yesterday, and you would not bring it,&rsquo; I grumbled.
      &lsquo;However, better late than never. Bring it now. If I must hang, I will
      hang like a gentleman. But depend upon it, the Cardinal will not serve an
      old friend so scurvy a trick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are to go to him,&rsquo; he announced, when he came back with the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? To the Cardinal?&rsquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; I exclaimed; and in my joy and relief I sprang up at once, and
      began to refresh my dress. &lsquo;So all this time I have been doing him an
      injustice,&rsquo; I continued. &lsquo;VIVE MONSEIGNEUR! Long live the little Bishop of
      Luchon! I might have known it, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make too sure!&rsquo; the man answered spitefully. Then he went on, &lsquo;I
      have something else for you. A friend of yours left it at the gate,&rsquo; and
      he handed me a packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite so!&rsquo; I said, leading his rascally face aright. &lsquo;And you kept it as
      long as you dared&mdash;as long as you thought I should hang, you knave!
      Was not that so? But there, do not lie to me. Tell me instead which of my
      friends left it.&rsquo; For, to confess the truth, I had not so many friends at
      this time and ten good crowns&mdash;the packet contained no less a sum&mdash;argued
      a pretty staunch friend, and one of whom a man might reasonably be proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knave sniggered maliciously. &lsquo;A crooked dwarfish man left it,&rsquo; he
      said. &lsquo;I doubt I might call him a tailor and not be far out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chut!&rsquo; I answered&mdash;but I was a little out of countenance,
      nevertheless. &lsquo;I understand. An honest fellow enough, and in debt to me! I
      am glad he remembered. But when am I to go, friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In an hour,&rsquo; he answered sullenly. Doubtless he had looked to get one of
      the crowns; but I was too old a hand for that. If I came back I could buy
      his services; and if I did not I should have wasted my money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, a little later, when I found myself on my way to the Hotel
      Richelieu under so close a guard that I could see nothing in the street
      except the figures that immediately surrounded me, I wished that I had
      given him the money. At such times, when all hangs in the balance and the
      sky is overcast, the mind runs on luck and old superstitions, and is prone
      to think a crown given here may avail there&mdash;though THERE be a
      hundred leagues away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palais Richelieu was at this time in building, and we were required to
      wait in a long, bare gallery, where the masons were at work. I was kept a
      full hour here, pondering uncomfortably on the strange whims and fancies
      of the great man who then ruled France as the King&rsquo;s Lieutenant-General,
      with all the King&rsquo;s powers, and whose life I had once been the means of
      saving by a little timely information. On occasion he had done something
      to wipe out the debt; and at other times he had permitted me to be free
      with him, and so far we were not unknown to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when the doors were at last thrown open, and I was led into
      his presence, my confidence underwent a shock. His cold glance, that,
      roving over me, regarded me not as a man but an item, the steely glitter
      of his southern eyes, chilled me to the bone. The room was bare, the floor
      without carpet or covering. Some of the woodwork lay about, unfinished and
      in pieces. But the man&mdash;this man, needed no surroundings. His keen
      pale face, his brilliant eyes, even his presence&mdash;though he was of no
      great height, and began already to stoop at the shoulders&mdash;were
      enough to awe the boldest. I recalled, as I looked at him, a hundred tales
      of his iron will, his cold heart, his unerring craft. He had humbled the
      King&rsquo;s brother, the splendid Duke of Orleans, in the dust. He had curbed
      the Queen-mother. A dozen heads, the noblest in France, had come to the
      block through him. Only two years before he had quelled Rochelle; only a
      few months before he had crushed the great insurrection in Languedoc: and
      though the south, stripped of its old privileges, still seethed with
      discontent, no one in this year 1630 dared lift a hand against him&mdash;openly,
      at any rate. Under the surface a hundred plots, a thousand intrigues,
      sought his life or his power; but these, I suppose, are the hap of every
      great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, then, that the courage on which I plumed myself sank low at
      sight of him; or that it was as much as I could do to mingle with the
      humility of my salute some touch of the SANG FROID of old
      acquaintanceship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps that had been better left out. For it seemed that this man was
      without bowels. For a moment, while he stood looking at me, and before he
      spoke to me, I gave myself up for lost. There was a glint of cruel
      satisfaction in his eyes that warned me, before he opened his mouth, what
      he was going to say to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not have made a better catch, M. de Berault,&rsquo; he said, smiling
      villainously, while he gently smoothed the fur of a cat that had sprung on
      the table beside him. &lsquo;An old offender, and an excellent example. I doubt
      it will not stop with you. But later, we will make you the warrant for
      flying at higher game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monseigneur has handled a sword himself,&rsquo; I blurted out. The very room
      seemed to be growing darker, the air colder. I was never nearer fear in my
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; he said, smiling delicately. &lsquo;And so&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will not be too hard on the failings of a poor gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall suffer no more than a rich one,&rsquo; he replied suavely as he
      stroked the cat. &lsquo;Enjoy that satisfaction, M. de Berault. Is that all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once I was of service to your Eminence,&rsquo; I said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Payment has been made,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;more than once. But for that I
      should not have seen you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King&rsquo;s face!&rsquo; I cried, snatching at the straw he seemed to hold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed cynically, smoothly. His thin face, his dark moustache, and
      whitening hair, gave him an air of indescribable keenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not the King,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Besides, I am told that you have killed as
      many as six men in duels. You owe the King, therefore, one life at least.
      You must pay it. There is no more to be said, M. de Berault,&rsquo; he continued
      coldly, turning away and beginning to collect some papers. &lsquo;The law must
      take its course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that he was about to nod to the lieutenant to withdraw me, and a
      chilling sweat broke out down my back. I saw the scaffold, I felt the
      cords. A moment, and it would be too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a favour to ask,&rsquo; I stammered desperately, &lsquo;if your Eminence will
      give me a moment alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To what end?&rsquo; he answered, turning and eyeing me with cold disfavour. &lsquo;I
      know you&mdash;your past&mdash;all. It can do no good, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No harm!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;And I am a dying man, Monseigneur!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; he said thoughtfully. Still he seemed to hesitate; and my
      heart beat fast. At last he looked at the lieutenant. &lsquo;You may leave us,&rsquo; 
      he said shortly. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he continued, when the officer had withdrawn and
      left us alone, &lsquo;what is it? Say what you have to say quickly. And, above
      all, do not try to fool me, M. de Berault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But his piercing eyes so disconcerted me now that I had my chance, and was
      alone with him, that I could not find a word to say, and stood before him
      mute. I think this pleased him, for his face relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man is not dead,&rsquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of that?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;That was not what you wanted to say to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once I saved your Eminence&rsquo;s life,&rsquo; I faltered miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Admitted,&rsquo; he answered, in his thin, incisive voice. &lsquo;You mentioned the
      fact before. On the other hand, you have taken six to my knowledge, M. de
      Berault. You have lived the life of a bully, a common bravo, a gamester.
      You, a man of family! For shame! Do you wonder that it has brought you to
      this! Yet on that one point I am willing to hear more,&rsquo; he added abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might save your Eminence&rsquo;s life again,&rsquo; I cried. It was a sudden
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know something?&rsquo; he said quickly, fixing me with his eyes. &lsquo;But no,&rsquo; 
      he continued, shaking his head gently. &lsquo;Pshaw! The trick is old. I have
      better spies than you, M. de Berault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But no better sword,&rsquo; I cried hoarsely. &lsquo;No, not in all your guard!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; he said slowly. &lsquo;That is true.&rsquo; To my surprise, he spoke
      in a tone of consideration; and he looked down at the floor. &lsquo;Let me
      think, my friend,&rsquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked two or three times up and down the room, while I stood
      trembling. I confess it, trembling. The man whose pulses danger has no
      power to quicken, is seldom proof against suspense; and the sudden hope
      his words awakened in me so shook me that his figure as he trod lightly to
      and fro with the cat rubbing against his robe and turning time for time
      with him, wavered before my eyes. I grasped the table to steady myself. I
      had not admitted even in my own mind how darkly the shadow of Montfaucon
      and the gallows had fallen across me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had leisure to recover myself, for it was some time before he spoke.
      When he did, it was in a voice harsh, changed, imperative. &lsquo;You have the
      reputation of a man faithful, at least, to his employer,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Do not
      answer me. I say it is so. Well, I will trust you. I will give you one
      more chance&mdash;though it is a desperate one. Woe to you if you fail me!
      Do you know Cocheforet in Bearn? It is not far from Auch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, your Eminence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor M. de Cocheforet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, your Eminence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much the better,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;But you have heard of him. He has been
      engaged in every Gascon plot since the late King&rsquo;s death, and gave more
      trouble last year in the Vivarais than any man twice his years. At present
      he is at Bosost in Spain, with other refugees, but I have learned that at
      frequent intervals he visits his wife at Cocheforet which is six leagues
      within the border. On one of these visits he must be arrested.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That should be easy,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal looked at me. &lsquo;Chut, man! what do you know about it?&rsquo; he
      answered bluntly. &lsquo;It is whispered at Cocheforet if a soldier crosses the
      street at Auch. In the house are only two or three servants, but they have
      the countryside with them to a man, and they are a dangerous breed. A
      spark might kindle a fresh rising. The arrest, therefore, must be made
      secretly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One resolute man inside the house,&rsquo; the Cardinal continued, thoughtfully
      glancing at a paper which lay on the table, &lsquo;with the help of two or three
      servants whom he could summon to his aid at will, might effect it. The
      question is, Will you be the man, my friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated; then I bowed. What choice had I?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, nay, speak out!&rsquo; he said sharply. &lsquo;Yes or no, M. de Berault?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Eminence,&rsquo; I said reluctantly. Again, I say, what choice had I?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will bring him to Paris, and alive. He knows things, and that is why
      I want him. You understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand, Monseigneur,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will get into the house as you can,&rsquo; he continued with energy. &lsquo;For
      that you will need strategy, and good strategy. They suspect everybody.
      You must deceive them. If you fail to deceive them, or, deceiving them,
      are found out later, I do not think that you will trouble me again, or
      break the edict a second time. On the other hand, should you deceive me&rsquo;&mdash;he
      smiled still more subtly, but his voice sank to a purring note&mdash;&lsquo;I
      will break you on the wheel like the ruined gamester you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I met his look without quailing. &lsquo;So be it!&rsquo; I said recklessly. &lsquo;If I do
      not bring M. de Cocheforet to Paris, you may do that to me, and more
      also!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a bargain!&rsquo; he answered slowly. &lsquo;I think that you will be faithful.
      For money, here are a hundred crowns. That sum should suffice; but if you
      succeed you shall have twice as much more. That is all, I think. You
      understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Monseigneur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why do you wait?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lieutenant?&rsquo; I said modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal laughed to himself, and sitting down wrote a word or two on a
      slip of paper. &lsquo;Give him that,&rsquo; he said in high good-humour. &lsquo;I fear, M.
      de Berault, you will never get your deserts&mdash;in this world!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. AT THE GREEN PILLAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cocheforet lies in a billowy land of oak and beech and chestnuts&mdash;a
      land of deep, leafy bottoms and hills clothed with forest. Ridge and
      valley, glen and knoll, the woodland, sparsely peopled and more sparsely
      tilled, stretches away to the great snow mountains that here limit France.
      It swarms with game&mdash;with wolves and bears, deer and boars. To the
      end of his life I have heard that the great king loved this district, and
      would sigh, when years and State fell heavily on him, for the beech groves
      and box-covered hills of South Bearn. From the terraced steps of Auch you
      can see the forest roll away in light and shadow, vale and upland, to the
      base of the snow peaks; and, though I come from Brittany and love the
      smell of the salt wind, I have seen few sights that outdo this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the second week of October, when I came to Cocheforet, and,
      dropping down from the last wooded brow, rode quietly into the place at
      evening. I was alone, and had ridden all day in a glory of ruddy beech
      leaves, through the silence of forest roads, across clear brooks and
      glades still green. I had seen more of the quiet and peace of the country
      than had been my share since boyhood, and for that reason, or because I
      had no great taste for the task before me&mdash;the task now so imminent&mdash;I
      felt a little hipped. In good faith, it was not a gentleman&rsquo;s work that I
      was come to do, look at it how you might.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beggars must not be choosers, and I knew that this feeling would not
      last. At the inn, in the presence of others, under the spur of necessity,
      or in the excitement of the chase, were that once begun, I should lose the
      feeling. When a man is young he seeks solitude, when he is middle-aged, he
      flies it and his thoughts. I made therefore for the &lsquo;Green Pillar,&rsquo; a
      little inn in the village street, to which I had been directed at Auch,
      and, thundering on the door with the knob of my riding switch, railed at
      the man for keeping me waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there at hovel doors in the street&mdash;which was a mean, poor
      place, not worthy of the name&mdash;men and women looked out at me
      suspiciously. But I affected to ignore them; and at last the host came. He
      was a fair-haired man, half-Basque, half-Frenchman, and had scanned me
      well, I was sure, through some window or peephole; for when he came out he
      betrayed no surprise at the sight of a well-dressed stranger&mdash;a
      portent in that out-of-the-way village&mdash;but eyed me with a kind of
      sullen reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can lie here to-night, I suppose?&rsquo; I said, dropping the reins on the
      sorrel&rsquo;s neck. The horse hung its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he answered stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed to the green bough which topped a post that stood opposite the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is an inn, is it not?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered slowly. &lsquo;It is an inn. But&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are full, or you are out of food, or your wife is ill, or
      something else is amiss,&rsquo; I answered peevishly. &lsquo;All the same, I am going
      to lie here. So you must make the best of it, and your wife too&mdash;if
      you have one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He scratched his head, looking at me with an ugly glitter in his eyes. But
      he said nothing, and I dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where can I stable my horse?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put it up,&rsquo; he answered sullenly, stepping forward and taking the
      reins in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;But I go with you. A merciful man is merciful to his
      beast, and wherever I go I see my horse fed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be fed,&rsquo; he said shortly. And then he waited for me to go into
      the house. &lsquo;The wife is in there,&rsquo; he continued, looking at me stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;IMPRIMIS&mdash;if you understand Latin, my friend,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;the
      horse in the stall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that it was no good, turned the sorrel slowly round, and began to
      lead it across the village street. There was a shed behind the inn, which
      I had already marked, and taken for the stable, I was surprised when I
      found that he was not going there, but I made no remark, and in a few
      minutes saw the horse made comfortable in a hovel which seemed to belong
      to a neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, the man led the way back to the inn, carrying my valise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no other guests?&rsquo; I said, with a casual air. I knew that he was
      watching me closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is not much in the way to anywhere, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was so evident, that I never saw a more retired place. The hanging
      woods, rising steeply to a great height, so shut the valley in that I was
      puzzled to think how a man could leave it save by the road I had come. The
      cottages, which were no more than mean, small huts, ran in a straggling
      double line, with many gaps&mdash;through fallen trees and ill-cleared
      meadows. Among them a noisy brook ran in and out, and the inhabitants&mdash;charcoal-burners,
      or swine-herds, or poor devils of the like class, were no better than
      their dwellings. I looked in vain for the Chateau. It was not to be seen,
      and I dared not ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man led me into the common room of the tavern&mdash;a low-roofed, poor
      place, lacking a chimney or glazed windows, and grimy with smoke and use.
      The fire&mdash;a great half-burned tree&mdash;smouldered on a stone
      hearth, raised a foot from the floor. A huge black pot simmered over it,
      and beside one window lounged a country fellow talking with the goodwife.
      In the dusk I could not see his face, but I gave the woman a word, and sat
      down to wait for my supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed more silent than the common run of her kind; but this might be
      because her husband was present. While she moved about getting my meal, he
      took his place against the door-post and fell to staring at me so
      persistently that I felt by no means at my ease. He was a tall, strong
      fellow, with a shaggy moustache and brown beard, cut in the mode Henri
      Quatre; and on the subject of that king&mdash;a safe one, I knew, with a
      Bearnais&mdash;and on that alone, I found it possible to make him talk.
      Even then there was a suspicious gleam in his eyes that bade me abstain
      from questions; so that as the darkness deepened behind him, and the
      firelight played more and more strongly on his features, and I thought of
      the leagues of woodland that lay between this remote valley and Auch, I
      recalled the Cardinal&rsquo;s warning that if I failed in my attempt I should be
      little likely to trouble Paris again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lout by the window paid no attention to me; nor I to him, when I had
      once satisfied myself that he was really what he seemed to be. But
      by-and-by two or three men&mdash;rough, uncouth fellows&mdash;dropped in
      to reinforce the landlord, and they, too seemed to have no other business
      than to sit in silence looking at me, or now and again to exchange a word
      in a PATOIS of their own. By the time my supper was ready, the knaves
      numbered six in all; and, as they were armed to a man with huge Spanish
      knives, and made it clear that they resented my presence in their dull
      rustic fashion&mdash;every rustic is suspicious&mdash;I began to think
      that, unwittingly, I had put my head into a wasps&rsquo; nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I ate and drank with apparent appetite; but little that
      passed within the circle of light cast by the smoky lamp escaped me. I
      watched the men&rsquo;s looks and gestures at least as sharply as they watched
      mine; and all the time I was racking my wits for some mode of disarming
      their suspicions, or failing that, of learning something more of the
      position, which far exceeded in difficulty and danger anything that I had
      expected. The whole valley, it would seem, was on the look-out to protect
      my man!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had purposely brought with me from Auch a couple of bottles of choice
      Armagnac; and these had been carried into the house with my saddle bags. I
      took one out now and opened it and carelessly offered a dram of the spirit
      to the landlord. He took it. As he drank it, I saw his face flush; he
      handed back the cup reluctantly, and on that hint I offered him another,
      The strong spirit was already beginning to work, and he accepted, and in a
      few minutes began to talk more freely and with less of the constraint
      which had before marked us all. Still, his tongue ran chiefly on questions&mdash;he
      would know this, he would learn that; but even this was a welcome change.
      I told him openly whence I had come, by what road, how long I had stayed
      in Auch, and where; and so far I satisfied his curiosity. Only, when I
      came to the subject of my visit to Cocheforet I kept a mysterious silence,
      hinting darkly at business in Spain and friends across the border, and
      this and that; in this way giving the peasants to understand, if they
      pleased, that I was in the same interest as their exiled master.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the bait, winked at one another, and began to look at me in a
      more friendly way&mdash;the landlord foremost. But when I had led them so
      far, I dared go no farther, lest I should commit myself and be found out.
      I stopped, therefore, and, harking back to general subjects, chanced to
      compare my province with theirs. The landlord, now become almost
      talkative, was not slow to take up this challenge; and it presently led to
      my acquiring a curious piece of knowledge. He was boasting of his great
      snow mountains, the forests that propped them, the bears that roamed in
      them, the izards that loved the ice, and the boars that fed on the oak
      mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, quite by chance, &lsquo;we have not these things, it is true.
      But we have things in the north you have not. We have tens of thousands of
      good horses&mdash;not such ponies as you breed here. At the horse fair at
      Fecamp my sorrel would be lost in the crowd. Here in the south you will
      not meet his match in a long day&rsquo;s journey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not make too sure of that,&rsquo; the man replied, his eyes bright with
      triumph and the dram. &lsquo;What would you say if I showed you a better&mdash;in
      my own stable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that his words sent a kind of thrill through his other hearers, and
      that such of them as understood for two or three of them talked their
      PATOIS only&mdash;looked at him angrily; and in a twinkling I began to
      comprehend. But I affected dullness, and laughed in scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seeing is believing,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I doubt if you knows good horse when you
      see one, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; he said, winking. &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I doubt it,&rsquo; I answered stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come with me, and I will show you one,&rsquo; he retorted, discretion
      giving way to vain-glory. His wife and the others, I saw, looked at him
      dumbfounded; but, without paying any heed to them, he rose, took up a
      lanthorn, and, assuming an air of peculiar wisdom, opened the door. &lsquo;Come
      with me,&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know a good horse when I see one, don&rsquo;t
      I? I know a better than yours, at any rate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I should not have been surprised if the other men had interfered; but I
      suppose he was a leader among them, they did not, and in a moment we were
      outside. Three paces through the darkness took us to the stable, an offset
      at the back of the inn. My man twirled the pin, and, leading the way in,
      raised his lanthorn. A horse whinnied softly, and turned its bright, mild
      eyes on us&mdash;a baldfaced chestnut, with white hairs in its tail and
      one white stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; my guide exclaimed, waving the lanthorn to and fro boastfully,
      that I might see its points. &lsquo;What do you say to that? Is that an
      undersized pony?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I answered, purposely stinting my praise. &lsquo;It is pretty fair&mdash;for
      this country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or any country,&rsquo; he answered wrathfully. &lsquo;Or any country, I say&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t care where it is! And I have reason to know! Why, man, that horse is&mdash;But
      there, that is a good horse, if ever you saw one!&rsquo; And with that he ended&mdash;abruptly
      and lamely; lowered the lanthorn with a sudden gesture, and turned to the
      door. He was on the instant in such hurry to leave that he almost
      shouldered me out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I understood. I knew that he had neatly betrayed all&mdash;that he had
      been on the point of blurting out that that was M. de Cocheforet&rsquo;s horse!
      M. Cocheforet&rsquo;s COMPRENEZ BIEN! And while I turned away my face in the
      darkness that he might not see me smile, I was not surprised to find the
      man in a moment changed, and become, in the closing of the door, as sober
      and suspicious as before, ashamed of himself and enraged with me, and in a
      mood to cut my throat for a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not my cue to quarrel, however. I made therefore, as if I had seen
      nothing, and when we were back in the inn praised the horse grudgingly,
      and like a man but half convinced. The ugly looks and ugly weapons I saw
      round me were fine incentives to caution; and no Italian, I flatter
      myself, could have played his part more nicely than I did. But I was
      heartily glad when it was over, and I found myself, at last, left alone
      for the night in a little garret&mdash;a mere fowl-house&mdash;upstairs,
      formed by the roof and gable walls, and hung with strings of apples and
      chestnuts. It was a poor sleeping-place&mdash;rough, chilly, and unclean.
      I ascended to it by a ladder; my cloak and a little fern formed my only
      bed. But I was glad to accept it, for it enabled me to be alone and to
      think out the position unwatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course M. de Cocheforet was at the Chateau. He had left his horse here,
      and gone up on foot; probably that was his usual plan. He was therefore
      within my reach, in one sense&mdash;I could not have come at a better time&mdash;but
      in another he was as much beyond it as if I were still in Paris. For so
      far was I from being able to seize him that I dared not ask a question, or
      let fall a rash word, or even look about me freely. I saw I dared not. The
      slightest hint of my mission, the faintest breath of distrust, would lead
      to throat-cutting&mdash;and the throat would be mine; while the longer I
      lay in the village, the greater suspicion I should incur, and the closer
      would be the watch kept upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a position some men might have given up the attempt in despair,
      and saved themselves across the border. But I have always valued myself on
      my fidelity, and I did not shrink. If not to-day, to-morrow; if not this
      time, next time. The dice do not always turn up aces. Bracing myself,
      therefore, to the occasion, I crept, as soon as the house was quiet, to
      the window, a small, square, open lattice, much cobwebbed, and partly
      stuffed with hay. I looked out. The village seemed to be asleep. The dark
      branches of trees hung a few feet away, and almost obscured a grey, cloudy
      sky, through which a wet moon sailed drearily. Looking downwards, I could
      at first see nothing; but as my eyes grew used to the darkness&mdash;I had
      only just put out my rushlight&mdash;I made out the stable door and the
      shadowy outlines of the lean-to roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had hoped for this, for I could now keep watch, and learn at least
      whether Cocheforet left before morning. If he did not, I should know he
      was still here. If he did, I should be the better for seeing his features,
      and learning, perhaps, other things that might be of use to me in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making up my mind to the uncomfortable, I sat down on the floor by the
      lattice, and began a vigil that might last, I knew, until morning. It did
      last about an hour, at the end of which time I heard whispering below,
      then footsteps; then, as some persons turned a corner, a voice speaking
      aloud and carelessly. I could not catch the words or meaning, but the
      voice was a gentleman&rsquo;s, and its bold accents and masterful tone left me
      in no doubt that the speaker was M. de Cocheforet himself. Hoping to learn
      more, I pressed my face nearer to the opening, and had just made out
      through the gloom two figures&mdash;one that of a tall, slight man,
      wearing a cloak, the other, I fancied, a woman&rsquo;s, in a sheeny white dress&mdash;when
      a thundering rap on the door of my garret made me spring back a yard from
      the lattice, and lie down hurriedly on my couch. The summons was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I cried, rising on my elbow, and cursing the untimely
      interruption. I was burning with anxiety to see more. &lsquo;What is it? What is
      the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The trap-door was lifted a foot or more. The landlord thrust up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You called, did you not?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up a rushlight, which illumined half the room and lit up his
      grinning face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Called&mdash;at this hour of the night, you fool?&rsquo; I answered angrily.
      &lsquo;No! I did not call. Go to bed, man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remained on the ladder, gaping stupidly. &lsquo;I heard you,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to bed! You are drunk,&rsquo; I answered, sitting up. &lsquo;I tell you I did not
      call.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, very well,&rsquo; he answered slowly. &lsquo;And you do not want anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing&mdash;except to be left alone,&rsquo; I replied sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night! Good-night!&rsquo; I answered with what patience I might. The tramp
      of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs as it was led out of the stable was in my ears at the
      moment. &lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo; I continued feverishly, hoping that he would still
      retire in time, and I have a chance to look out. &lsquo;I want to sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; he said, with a broad grin. &lsquo;But it is early yet, and you have
      plenty of time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, at last, he slowly let down the trap-door, and I heard him
      chuckle as he went down the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he reached the bottom I was at the window. The woman, whom I had
      seen, still stood below in the same place, and beside her was a man in a
      peasant&rsquo;s dress, holding a lanthorn. But the man, the man I wanted to see,
      was no longer there. He was gone, and it was evident that the others no
      longer feared me; for while I gazed the landlord came out to them with
      another lanthorn swinging in his hand, and said something to the lady, and
      she looked up at my window and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm night, and she wore nothing over her white dress. I could
      see her tall, shapely figure and shining eyes, and the firm contour of her
      beautiful face, which, if any fault might be found with it, erred in being
      too regular. She looked like a woman formed by nature to meet dangers and
      difficulties, and to play a great part; even here, at midnight, in the
      midst of these desperate men, she did not seem out of place. I could fancy&mdash;I
      did not find it impossible to fancy&mdash;that under her queenly exterior,
      and behind the contemptuous laugh with which she heard the landlord&rsquo;s
      story, there lurked a woman&rsquo;s soul, a soul capable of folly and
      tenderness. But no outward sign betrayed its presence&mdash;as I saw her
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scanned her very carefully; and secretly, if the truth be told, I was
      glad to find that Madame de Cocheforet was such a woman. I was glad that
      she had laughed as she had&mdash;with a ring of disdain and defiance; glad
      that she was not a little, tender, child-like woman, to be crushed by the
      first pinch of trouble. For if I succeeded in my task, if I contrived to&mdash;but,
      pish! Women, I told myself, were all alike. She would find consolation
      quickly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched until the group broke up, and Madame, with one of the men, went
      her way round the corner of the inn, and out of my sight. Then I retired
      to bed again, feeling more than ever perplexed what course I should adopt.
      It was clear that to succeed I must obtain admission to the house, which
      was garrisoned, according to my instructions, by two or three old
      men-servants only, and as many women; since Madame, to disguise her
      husband&rsquo;s visits the more easily, lived, and gave out that she lived, in
      great retirement. To seize her husband at home, therefore, might be no
      impossible task; though here, in the heart of the village, a troop of
      horse might make the attempt, and fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how was I to gain admission to the house&mdash;a house guarded by
      quick-witted women, and fenced with all the precautions love could devise?
      That was the question; and dawn found me still debating it, still as far
      as ever from an answer. Anxious and feverish, I was glad when the light
      came, and I could get up. I thought that the fresh air might inspire me,
      and I was tired of my stuffy closet. I crept stealthily down the ladder,
      and managed to pass unseen through the lower room, in which several
      persons were snoring heavily. The outer door was not fastened, and in a
      hand-turn I was in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still so early that the trees stood up black against the reddening
      sky, but the bough upon the post before the door was growing green, and in
      a few minutes the grey light would be everywhere. Already, even in the
      roadway, there was a glimmering of it; and as I stood at the corner of the
      house&mdash;where I could command both the front and the side on which the
      stable opened&mdash;sniffing the fresh air, and looking for any trace of
      the midnight departure, my eyes detected something light-coloured lying on
      the ground. It was not more than two or three paces from me, and I stepped
      to it and picked it up curiously, hoping that it might be a note. It was
      not a note, however, but a tiny orange-coloured sachet such as women carry
      in the bosom. It was full of some faintly-scented powder, and bore on one
      side the initial &lsquo;E,&rsquo; worked in white silk; and was altogether a dainty
      little toy, such as women love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless Madame de Cocheforet had dropped it in the night. I turned it
      over and over; and then I put it in my pouch with a smile, thinking that
      it might be useful sometime, and in some way. I had scarcely done this,
      and turned with the intention of exploring the street, when the door
      behind me creaked on its leather hinges, and in a moment the host stood at
      my elbow, and gave me a surly greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently his suspicions were again aroused, for from this time he managed
      to be with me, on one pretence or another until noon. Moreover, his manner
      grew each moment more churlish, his hints plainer; until I could scarcely
      avoid noticing the one or the other. About mid-day, having followed me for
      the twentieth time into the street, he came to the point by asking me
      rudely if I did not need my horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Why do you ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; he answered, with an ugly smile, &lsquo;this is not a very healthy
      place for strangers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I retorted. &lsquo;But the border air suits me, you see,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lucky answer, for, taken with my talk the night before, it
      puzzled him, by suggesting that I was on the losing side, and had my
      reasons for lying near Spain. Before he had done scratching his head over
      it, the clatter of hoofs broke the sleepy quiet of the village street, and
      the lady I had seen the night before rode quickly round the corner, and
      drew her horse on to its haunches. Without looking at me, she called to
      the innkeeper to come to her stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went. The moment his back was turned, I slipped away, and in a
      twinkling was hidden by a house. Two or three glum-looking fellows stared
      at me as I passed down the street, but no one moved; and in two minutes I
      was clear of the village, and in a half-worn track which ran through the
      wood, and led&mdash;if my ideas were right&mdash;to the Chateau. To
      discover the house and learn all that was to be learned about its
      situation were my most pressing needs; and these, even at the risk of a
      knife thrust, I was determined to satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not gone two hundred paces along the path, however, before I heard
      the tread of a horse behind me, and I had just time to hide myself before
      Madame came up and rode by me, sitting her horse gracefully, and with all
      the courage of a northern woman. I watched her pass, and then, assured by
      her presence that I was in the right road, I hurried after her. Two
      minutes walking at speed brought me to a light wooden bridge spanning a
      stream. I crossed this, and, as the wood opened, saw before me first a
      wide, pleasant meadow, and beyond this a terrace. On the terrace, pressed
      upon on three sides by thick woods, stood a grey mansion, with the corner
      tourelles, steep, high roofs, and round balconies, that men loved and
      built in the days of the first Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of good size, but wore a gloomy aspect. A great yew hedge, which
      seemed to enclose a walk or bowling-green, hid the ground floor of the
      east wing from view, while a formal rose garden, stiff even in neglect,
      lay in front of the main building. The west wing, of which the lower roofs
      fell gradually away to the woods, probably contained the stables and
      granaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood a moment only, but I marked all, and noted how the road reached
      the house, and which windows were open to attack; then I turned and
      hastened back. Fortunately, I met no one between the house and the
      village, and was able to enter my host&rsquo;s with an air of the most complete
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short as had been my absence, however, I found things altered there. Round
      the door lounged three strangers&mdash;stout, well-armed fellows, whose
      bearing, as they loitered and chattered, suggested a curious mixture of
      smugness and independence. Half a dozen pack-horses stood tethered to the
      post in front of the house; and the landlord&rsquo;s manner, from being rude and
      churlish only, had grown perplexed and almost timid. One of the strangers,
      I soon found, supplied him with wine; the others were travelling
      merchants, who rode in the first one&rsquo;s company for the sake of safety. All
      were substantial men from Tarbes&mdash;solid burgesses; and I was not long
      in guessing that my host, fearing what might leak out before them, and,
      particularly, that I might refer to the previous night&rsquo;s disturbance, was
      on tenter-hooks while they remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time this did not suggest anything to me. But when we had all taken
      our seats for supper, there came an addition to the party. The door
      opened, and the fellow whom I had seen the night before with Madame de
      Cocheforet entered and took a stool by the fire. I felt sure that he was
      one of the servants at the Chateau; and in a flash his presence inspired
      me with the most feasible plan for obtaining admission which I had yet hit
      upon. I felt myself grow hot at the thought&mdash;it seemed so full of
      promise, yet so doubtful&mdash;and, on the instant, without giving myself
      time to think too much, I began to carry it into effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called for two or three bottles of better wine, and, assuming a jovial
      air, passed it round the table. When we had drunk a few glasses I fell to
      talking, and, choosing politics, took the side of the Languedoc party and
      the malcontents in so reckless a fashion that the innkeeper was beside
      himself at my imprudence. The merchants, who belonged to the class with
      whom the Cardinal was always most popular, looked first astonished and
      then enraged. But I was not to be checked; hints and sour looks were lost
      upon me. I grew more outspoken with every glass, I drank to the
      Rochellois, I swore it would not be long before they raised their heads
      again; and, at last, while the innkeeper and his wife were engaged
      lighting the lamp, I passed round the bottle and called on all for a
      toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one to begin,&rsquo; I bragged noisily. &lsquo;A gentleman&rsquo;s toast! A
      southern toast! Here is confusion to the Cardinal, and a health to all who
      hate him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MON DIEU!&rsquo; one of the strangers cried, springing from his seat in a rage.
      &lsquo;I am not going to stomach that! Is your house a common treason-hole,&rsquo; he
      continued, turning furiously on the landlord, &lsquo;that you suffer this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hoity-toity!&rsquo; I answered, coolly keeping my seat. &lsquo;What is all this?
      Don&rsquo;t you relish my toast, little man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;nor you!&rsquo; he retorted hotly; &lsquo;whoever you may be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will give you another,&rsquo; I answered, with a hiccough. &lsquo;Perhaps it
      will be more to your taste. Here is the Duke of Orleans, and may he soon
      be King!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE HOUSE IN THE WOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Words so reckless fairly shook the three men out of their anger. For a
      moment they glared at me as if they had seen a ghost. Then the wine
      merchant clapped his hand on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is enough,&rsquo; he said, with a look at his companions. &lsquo;I think that
      there can be no mistake about that. As damnable treason as ever I heard
      whispered! I congratulate you, sir, on your boldness. As for you,&rsquo; he
      continued, turning with an ugly sneer to the landlord, &lsquo;I shall know now
      the company you keep! I was not aware that my wine wet whistles to such a
      tune!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he was startled, the innkeeper was furious, seeing his character
      thus taken away; and, being at no time a man of many words, he vented his
      rage exactly in the way I wished, raising in a twinkling such an uproar as
      can scarcely be conceived. With a roar like a bull&rsquo;s, he ran headlong at
      the table, and overturned it on the top of me. Fortunately the woman saved
      the lamp, and fled with it into a corner, whence she and the man from the
      Chateau watched the skirmish in silence; but the pewter cups and platters
      flew spinning across the floor, while the table pinned me to the ground
      among the ruins of my stool. Having me at this disadvantage&mdash;for at
      first I made no resistance the landlord began to belabour me with the
      first thing he snatched up, and when I tried to defend myself, cursed me
      with each blow for a treacherous rogue and a vagrant. Meanwhile the three
      merchants, delighted with the turn things had taken, skipped round us
      laughing, and now hounded him on, now bantered me with &lsquo;how is that for
      the Duke of Orleans?&rsquo; and &lsquo;How now, traitor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I thought that this had lasted long enough&mdash;or, to speak more
      plainly, when I could stand the innkeeper&rsquo;s drubbing no longer&mdash;I
      threw him off, and struggled to my feet; but still, though the blood was
      trickling down my face, I refrained from drawing my sword. I caught up
      instead a leg of the stool which lay handy, and, watching my opportunity,
      dealt the landlord a shrewd blow under the ear, which laid him out in a
      moment on the wreck of his own table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I cried, brandishing my new weapon, which fitted the hand to a
      nicety, &lsquo;come on! Come on! if you dare to strike a blow, you peddling,
      truckling, huckstering knaves! A fig for you and your shaveling Cardinal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced wine merchant drew his sword in a one-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you drunken fool,&rsquo; he said wrathfully, &lsquo;put that stick down, or I
      will spit you like a lark!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lark in your teeth!&rsquo; I cried, staggering as if the wine were in my head.
      &lsquo;And cuckoo, too! Another word, and I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a couple of savage passes at me, but in a twinkling his sword flew
      across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;VOILA!&rsquo; I shouted, lurching forward, as if I had luck and not skill to
      thank for my victory. &lsquo;Now, the next! Come on, come on&mdash;you
      white-livered knaves!&rsquo; And, pretending a drunken frenzy, I flung my weapon
      bodily amongst them, and seizing the nearest, began to wrestle with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment they all threw themselves upon me, and, swearing copiously,
      bore me back to the door. The wine merchant cried breathlessly to the
      woman to open it, and in a twinkling they had me through it, and half-way
      across the road. The one thing I feared was a knife-thrust in the MELEE;
      but I had to run that risk, and the men were honest, and, thinking me
      drunk, indulgent. In a trice I found myself on my back in the dirt, with
      my head humming; and heard the bars of the door fall noisily into their
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and went to the door, and, to play out my part, hammered on it
      frantically; crying out to them to let me in. But the three travellers
      only jeered at me, and the landlord, coming to the window, with his head
      bleeding, shook his fist at me, and cursed me for a mischief-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baffled in this, I retired to a log which lay in the road a few paces from
      the house, and sat down on it to await events. With torn clothes and
      bleeding face, hatless and covered with dirt, I was in little better case
      than my opponent. It was raining, too, and the dripping branches swayed
      over my head. The wind was in the south&mdash;the coldest quarter. I began
      to feel chilled and dispirited. If my scheme failed, I had forfeited roof
      and bed to no purpose, and placed future progress out of the question. It
      was a critical moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last that happened for which I had been looking. The door swung
      open a few inches, and a man came noiselessly out; it was quickly barred
      behind him. He stood a moment, waiting on the threshold and peering into
      the gloom; and seemed to expect to be attacked. Finding himself
      unmolested, however, and all quiet, he went off steadily down the street&mdash;towards
      the Chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      I let a couple of minutes go by, and then I followed. I had no difficulty
      in hitting on the track at the end of the street, but when I had once
      plunged into the wood, I found myself in darkness so intense that I soon
      strayed from the path, and fell over roots, and tore my clothes with
      thorns, and lost my temper twenty times before I found the path again.
      However, I gained the bridge at last, and thence caught sight of a light
      twinkling before me. To make for it across the meadow and terrace was an
      easy task; yet, when I had reached the door and had hammered upon it, I
      was so worn out, and in so sorry a plight that I sank down, and had little
      need to play a part, or pretend to be worse than I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time no one answered. The dark house towering above me remained
      silent. I could hear, mingled with the throbbings of my heart, the steady
      croaking of the frogs in a pond near the stables; but no other sound. In a
      frenzy of impatience and disgust, I stood up again and hammered, kicking
      with my heels on the nail-studded door, and crying out desperately,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A MOI! A MOI!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, or a moment later, I heard a remote door opened; footsteps as of
      more than one person drew near. I raised my voice and cried again,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A MOI!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; a voice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman in distress,&rsquo; I answered piteously, moving my hands across
      the door. &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake open and let me in. I am hurt, and dying of
      cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What brings you here?&rsquo; the voice asked sharply. Despite its tartness, I
      fancied that it was a woman&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven knows!&rsquo; I answered desperately. &lsquo;I cannot tell. They maltreated me
      at the inn, and threw me into the street. I crawled away, and have been
      wandering in the wood for hours. Then I saw a light here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On that some muttering took place on the other side of the door&mdash;to
      which I had my ear. It ended in the bars being lowered. The door swung
      partly open, and a light shone out, dazzling me. I tried to shade my eyes
      with my fingers, and, as did so, fancied I heard a murmur of pity. But
      when I looked in under screen of my hand, I saw only one person&mdash;the
      man who held the light, and his aspect was so strange, so terrifying,
      that, shaken as I was by fatigue, I recoiled a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall and very thin man, meanly dressed in a short, scanty jacket
      and well-darned hose. Unable, for some reason, to bend his neck, he
      carried his head with a strange stiffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that head&mdash;never did living man show a face so like death. His
      forehead was bald and yellow, his cheek-bones stood out under the strained
      skin, all the lower part of his face fell in, his jaws receded, his cheeks
      were hollow, his lips and chin were thin and fleshless. He seemed to have
      only one expression&mdash;a fixed grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood looking at this formidable creature, he made a quick
      movement to shut the door again, smiling more widely. I had the presence
      of mind to thrust in my foot, and, before he could resent the act, a voice
      in the background cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Clon! Stand back, stand back! do you hear? I am afraid,
      Monsieur, that you are hurt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words were my welcome to that house; and, spoken at an hour and in
      circumstances so gloomy, they made a lasting impression. Round the hall
      ran a gallery, and this, the height of the apartment, and the dark
      panelling seemed to swallow up the light. I stood within the entrance (as
      it seemed to me) of a huge cave; the skull-headed porter had the air of an
      ogre. Only the voice which greeted me dispelled the illusion. I turned
      trembling towards the quarter whence it came, and, shading my eyes, made
      out a woman&rsquo;s form standing in a doorway under the gallery. A second
      figure, which I took to be that of the servant I had seen at the inn,
      loomed uncertainly beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed in silence. My teeth were chattering. I was faint without
      feigning, and felt a kind of terror, hard to explain, at the sound of this
      woman&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of our people has told me about you, she continued, speaking out of
      the darkness. &lsquo;I am sorry that this has happened to you here, but I am
      afraid that you were indiscreet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take all the blame, Madame,&rsquo; I answered humbly. &lsquo;I ask only shelter for
      the night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The time has not yet come when we cannot give our friends that!&rsquo; she
      answered with noble courtesy. &lsquo;When it does, Monsieur, we shall be
      homeless ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shivered, looking anywhere but at her; for, if the truth be told, I had
      not sufficiently pictured this scene of my arrival&mdash;I had not
      foredrawn its details; and now I took part in it I felt a miserable
      meanness weigh me down. I had never from the first liked the work, but I
      had had no choice, and I had no choice now. Luckily, the guise in which I
      came, my fatigue, and wound were a sufficient mask, or I should have
      incurred suspicion at once. For I am sure that if ever in this world a
      brave man wore a hang-dog air, or Gil de Berault fell below himself, it
      was then and there&mdash;on Madame de Cocheforet&rsquo;s threshold, with her
      welcome sounding in my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      One, I think, did suspect me. Clon, the porter, continued to hold the door
      obstinately ajar and to eye me with grinning spite, until his mistress,
      with some sharpness, bade him drop the bars and conduct me to a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you go also, Louis,&rsquo; she continued, speaking to the man beside her,
      &lsquo;and see this gentleman comfortably disposed. I am sorry,&rsquo; she added,
      addressing me in the graceful tone she had before used, and I thought that
      I could see her head bend in the darkness, &lsquo;that our present circumstances
      do not permit us to welcome you more fitly, Monsieur. But the troubles of
      the times&mdash;however, you will excuse what is lacking. Until to-morrow,
      I have the honour to bid you good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, Madame,&rsquo; I stammered, trembling. I had not been able to
      distinguish her face in the gloom of the doorway, but her voice, her
      greeting, her presence unmanned me. I was troubled and perplexed; I had
      not spirit to kick a dog. I followed the two servants from the hall
      without heeding how we went; nor was it until we came to a full stop at a
      door in a white-washed corridor, and it was forced upon me that something
      was in question between my two conductors that I began to take notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that one of them, Louis, wished to lodge me here where we
      stood. The porter, on the other hand, who held the keys, would not. He did
      not speak a word, nor did the other&mdash;and this gave a queer ominous
      character to the debate; but he continued to jerk his head towards the
      farther end of the corridor; and, at last, he carried his point. Louis
      shrugged his shoulders, and moved on, glancing askance at me; and I, not
      understanding the matter in debate, followed the pair in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached the end of the corridor, and there for an instant the monster
      with the keys paused and grinned at me. Then he turned into a narrow
      passage on the left, and after following it for some paces, halted before
      a small, strong door. His key jarred in the lock, but he forced it
      shrieking round, and with a savage flourish threw the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked in and saw a mean, bare chamber with barred windows. The floor
      was indifferently clean, there was no furniture. The yellow light of the
      lanthorn falling on the stained walls gave the place the look of a
      dungeon. I turned to the two men. &lsquo;This is not a very good room,&rsquo; I said.
      &lsquo;And it feels damp. Have you no other?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis looked doubtfully at his companion. But the porter shook his head
      stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why does he not speak?&rsquo; I asked with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is dumb,&rsquo; Louis answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dumb!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;But he hears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has ears,&rsquo; the servant answered drily. &lsquo;But he has no tongue,
      Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shuddered. &lsquo;How did he lose it?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Rochelle. He was a spy, and the king&rsquo;s people took him the day the
      town surrendered. They spared his life, but cut out his tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I said. I wished to say more, to be natural, to show myself at my
      ease. But the porter&rsquo;s eyes seemed to burn into me, and my own tongue
      clave to the roof of my mouth. He opened his lips and pointed to his
      throat with a horrid gesture, and I shook my head and turned from him&mdash;&lsquo;You
      can let me have some bedding?&rsquo; I murmured hastily, for the sake of saying
      something, and to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, Monsieur,&rsquo; Louis answered. &lsquo;I will fetch some.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, thinking doubtless that Clon would stay with me. But after
      waiting a minute the porter strode off also with the lanthorn, leaving me
      to stand in the middle of the damp, dark room and reflect on the position.
      It was plain that Clon suspected me. This prison-like room, with its
      barred window, at the back of the house, and in the wing farthest from the
      stables, proved so much. Clearly, he was a dangerous fellow, of whom I
      must beware. I had just begun to wonder how Madame could keep such a
      monster in her house, when I heard his step returning. He came in,
      lighting Louis, who carried a small pallet and a bundle of coverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dumb man had, besides the lanthorn, a bowl of water and a piece of rag
      in his hand. He set them down, and going out again, fetched in a stool.
      Then he hung up the lanthorn on a nail, took the bowl and rag, and invited
      me to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was loth to let him touch me; but he continued to stand over me,
      pointing and grinning with dark persistence, and rather than stand on a
      trifle I sat down at last and gave him his way. He bathed my head
      carefully enough, and I daresay did it good; but I understood. I knew that
      his only desire was to learn whether the cut was real or a pretence, and I
      began to fear him more and more; until he was gone from the room, I dared
      scarcely lift my face lest he should read too much in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone, even, I felt uncomfortable, this seemed so sinister a business, and
      so ill begun. I was in the house. But Madame&rsquo;s frank voice haunted me, and
      the dumb man&rsquo;s eyes, full of suspicion and menace. When I presently got up
      and tried my door, I found it locked. The room smelt dank and close&mdash;like
      a vault. I could not see through the barred window, but I could hear the
      boughs sweep it in ghostly fashion; and I guessed that it looked out where
      the wood grew close to the walls of the house, and that even in the day
      the sun never peeped through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, tired and worn out, I slept at last. When I awoke the room
      was full of grey light, the door stood open, and Louis, looking ashamed of
      himself, waited by my pallet with a cup of wine in his hand, and some
      bread and fruit on a platter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will Monsieur be good enough to rise?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It is eight o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willingly,&rsquo; I answered tartly. &lsquo;Now that the door is unlocked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned red. &lsquo;It was an oversight,&rsquo; he stammered &lsquo;Clon is accustomed to
      lock the door, and he did it inadvertently, forgetting that there was
      anyone&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Inside,&rsquo; I said drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;Well, I do not think the oversight would please Madame
      de Cocheforet if she heard of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Monsieur would have the kindness not to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mention it, my good fellow?&rsquo; answered, looking at him with meaning as I
      rose. &lsquo;No. But it must not occur again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that this man was not like Clon. He had the instincts of the family
      servant, and freed from the influences of fear and darkness felt ashamed
      of his conduct. While he arranged my clothes, he looked round the room
      with an air of distaste, and muttered once or twice that the furniture of
      the principal chambers was packed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. de Cocheforet is abroad, I think?&rsquo; I said as I dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And likely to remain there,&rsquo; the man answered carelessly, shrugging his
      shoulders. &lsquo;Monsieur will doubtless have heard that he is in trouble. In
      the meantime, the house is TRISTE, and Monsieur must overlook much, if he
      stays. Madame lives retired, and the roads are ill-made and visitors few.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When the lion was ill the jackals left him,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis nodded. &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; he answered simply. He made no boast or brag
      on his own account, I noticed; and it came home to me that he was a
      faithful fellow, such as I love. I questioned him discreetly, and learned
      that he and Clon and an older man who lived over the stables were the only
      male servants left of a great household. Madame, her sister-in-law, and
      three women completed the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me some time to repair my wardrobe, so that I daresay it was
      nearly ten when I left my dismal little room. I found Louis waiting in the
      corridor, and he told me that Madame de Cocheforet and Mademoiselle were
      in the rose garden, and would be pleased to receive me. I nodded, and he
      guided me through several dim passages to a parlour with an open door,
      through which the sun shone gaily on the floor. Cheered by the morning air
      and this sudden change to pleasantness and life, I stepped lightly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies were walking up and down a wide path which bisected the
      garden. The weeds grew rankly in the gravel underfoot, the rose bushes
      which bordered the walk thrust their branches here and there in untrained
      freedom, a dark yew hedge which formed the background bristled with rough
      shoots and sadly needed trimming. But I did not see any of these things.
      The grace, the noble air, the distinction of the two women who paced
      slowly to meet me&mdash;and who shared all these qualities, greatly as
      they differed in others&mdash;left me no power to notice trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was a head shorter than her BELLE-SOEUR&mdash;a slender woman
      and petite, with a beautiful face and a fair complexion; a woman wholly
      womanly. She walked with dignity, but beside Madame&rsquo;s stately figure she
      had an air almost childish. And it was characteristic of the two that
      Mademoiselle as they drew near to me regarded me with sorrowful attention,
      Madame with a grave smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed low. They returned the salute. &lsquo;This is my sister,&rsquo; Madame de
      Cocheforet said, with a very slight air of condescension, &lsquo;Will you please
      to tell me your name, Monsieur?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am M. de Barthe, a gentleman of Normandy,&rsquo; I said, taking on impulse
      the name of my mother. My own, by a possibility, might be known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame&rsquo;s face wore a puzzled look. &lsquo;I do not know that name, I think,&rsquo; she
      said thoughtfully. Doubtless she was going over in her mind all the names
      with which conspiracy had made her familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is my misfortune, Madame,&rsquo; I said humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevertheless I am going to scold you,&rsquo; she rejoined, still eyeing me with
      some keenness. &lsquo;I am glad to see that you are none the worse for your
      adventure&mdash;but others may be. And you should have borne that in mind,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think that I hurt the man seriously,&rsquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not refer to that,&rsquo; she answered coldly. &lsquo;You know, or should know,
      that we are in disgrace here; that the Government regards us already with
      an evil eye, and that a very small thing would lead them to garrison the
      village, and perhaps oust us from the little the wars have left us. You
      should have known this, and considered it,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;Whereas&mdash;I
      do not say that you are a braggart, M. de Barthe. But on this one occasion
      you seem to have played the part of one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame, I did not think,&rsquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want of thought causes much evil,&rsquo; she answered, smiling. &lsquo;However, I
      have spoken, and we trust that while you stay with us you will be more
      careful. For the rest, Monsieur,&rsquo; she continued graciously, raising her
      hand to prevent me speaking, &lsquo;we do not know why you are here, or what
      plans you are pursuing. And we do not wish to know. It is enough that you
      are of our side. This house is at your service as long as you please to
      use it. And if we can aid you in any other way we will do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame!&rsquo; I exclaimed; and there I stopped. I could say no more. The rose
      garden, with its air of neglect, the shadow of the quiet house that fell
      across it, the great yew hedge which backed it, and was the pattern of one
      under which I had played in childhood&mdash;all had points that pricked
      me. But the women&rsquo;s kindness, their unquestioning confidence, the noble
      air of hospitality which moved them! Against these and their placid beauty
      in its peaceful frame I had no shield, no defence. I turned away, and
      feigned to be overcome by gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no words&mdash;to thank you!&rsquo; I muttered presently. &lsquo;I am a little
      shaken this morning. I&mdash;pardon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will leave you for a while,&rsquo; Mademoiselle de Cocheforet said in gentle
      pitying tones. &lsquo;The air will revive you. Louis shall call you when we go
      to dinner, M. de Barthe. Come, Elise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed low to hide my face, and they nodded pleasantly&mdash;not looking
      closely at me&mdash;as they walked by me to the house. I watched the two
      gracious, pale-robed figures until the doorway swallowed them, and then I
      walked away to a quiet corner where the shrubs grew highest and the yew
      hedge threw its deepest shadow, and I stood to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, MON DIEU, strange thoughts. If the oak can think at the moment the
      wind uproots it, or the gnarled thorn-bush when the landslip tears it from
      the slope, they may have such thoughts, I stared at the leaves, at the
      rotting blossoms, into the dark cavities of the hedge; I stared
      mechanically, dazed and wondering. What was the purpose for which I was
      here? What was the work I had come to do? Above all, how&mdash;my God! how
      was I to do it in the face of these helpless women, who trusted me, who
      believed in me, who opened their house to me? Clon had not frightened me,
      nor the loneliness of the leagued village, nor the remoteness of this
      corner where the dread Cardinal seemed a name, and the King&rsquo;s writ ran
      slowly, and the rebellion long quenched elsewhere, still smouldered. But
      Madame&rsquo;s pure faith, the younger woman&rsquo;s tenderness&mdash;how was I to
      face these?
    </p>
    <p>
      I cursed the Cardinal&mdash;would he had stayed at Luchon. I cursed the
      English fool who had brought me to this, I cursed the years of plenty and
      scarceness, and the Quartier Marais, and Zaton&rsquo;s, where I had lived like a
      pig, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A touch fell on my arm. I turned. It was Clon. How he had stolen up so
      quietly, how long he had been at my elbow, I could not tell. But his eyes
      gleamed spitefully in their deep sockets, and he laughed with his
      fleshless lips; and I hated him. In the daylight the man looked more like
      a death&rsquo;s-head than ever. I fancied that I read in his face that he knew
      my secret, and I flashed into rage at sight of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; I cried, with another oath. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t lay your corpse-claws on
      me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He mowed at me, and, bowing with ironical politeness, pointed to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Madame served?&rsquo; I said impatiently, crushing down my anger. &lsquo;Is that
      what you mean, fool?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I retorted. &lsquo;I can find my way then. You may go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell behind, and I strode back through the sunshine and flowers, and
      along the grass-grown paths, to the door by which I had come I walked
      fast, but his shadow kept pace with me, driving out the unaccustomed
      thoughts in which I had been indulging. Slowly but surely it darkened my
      mood. After all, this was a little, little place; the people who lived
      here&mdash;I shrugged my shoulders. France, power, pleasure, life,
      everything worth winning, worth having, lay yonder in the great city. A
      boy might wreck himself here for a fancy; a man of the world, never. When
      I entered the room, where the two ladies stood waiting for me by the
      table, I was nearly my old self again. And a chance word presently
      completed the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clon made you understand, then?&rsquo; the young woman said kindly, as I took
      my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered. On that I saw the two smile at one
      another, and I added: &lsquo;He is a strange creature. I wonder that you can
      bear to have him near you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor man! You do not know his story?&rsquo; Madame said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard something of it,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Louis told me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I do shudder at him sometimes,&rsquo; she replied, in a low voice. &lsquo;He
      has suffered&mdash;and horribly, and for us. But I wish that it had been
      on any other service. Spies are necessary things, but one does not wish to
      have to do with them! Anything in the nature of treachery is so horrible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick, Louis!&rsquo; Mademoiselle exclaimed, &lsquo;the cognac, if you have any
      there! I am sure that you are&mdash;still feeling ill, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I thank you,&rsquo; I muttered hoarsely, making an effort to recover
      myself. &lsquo;I am quite well. It was&mdash;an old wound that sometimes touches
      me.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. MADAME AND MADEMOISELLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      To be frank, however, it was not the old wound that touched me so nearly,
      but Madame&rsquo;s words; which, finishing what Clon&rsquo;s sudden appearance in the
      garden had begun, went a long way towards hardening me and throwing me
      back into myself. I saw with bitterness&mdash;what I had perhaps forgotten
      for a moment&mdash;how great was the chasm that separated me from these
      women; how impossible it was that we could long think alike; how far apart
      in views, in experience, in aims we were. And while I made a mock in my
      heart of their high-flown sentiments&mdash;or thought I did&mdash;I
      laughed no less at the folly which had led me to dream, even for a moment,
      that I could, at my age, go back&mdash;go back and risk all for a whim, a
      scruple, the fancy of a lonely hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I daresay something of this showed in my face; for Madame&rsquo;s eyes mirrored
      a dim reflection of trouble as she looked at me, and Mademoiselle talked
      nervously and at random. At any rate, I fancied so, and I hastened to
      compose myself; and the two, in pressing upon me the simple dainties of
      the table soon forgot, or appeared to forget, the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in spite of this CONTRETEMPS, that first meal had a strange charm for
      me. The round table whereat we dined was spread inside the open door which
      led to the garden, so that the October sunshine fell full on the spotless
      linen and quaint old plate, and the fresh balmy air filled the room with
      the scent of sweet herbs. Louis served us with the mien of a major-domo,
      and set on each dish as though it had been a peacock or a mess of
      ortolans. The woods provided the larger portion of our meal; the garden
      did its part; the confections Mademoiselle had cooked with her own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, as the meal went on, as Louis trod to and fro across the
      polished floor, and the last insects of summer hummed sleepily outside,
      and the two gracious faces continued to smile at me out of the gloom&mdash;for
      the ladies sat with their backs to the door&mdash;I began to dream again,
      I began to sink again into folly, that was half-pleasure, half-pain. The
      fury of the gaming-house and the riot of Zaton&rsquo;s seemed far away. The
      triumphs of the fencing-room&mdash;even they grew cheap and tawdry. I
      thought of existence as one outside it, I balanced this against that, and
      wondered whether, after all, the red soutane were so much better than the
      homely jerkin, or the fame of a day than ease and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      And life at Cocheforet was all after the pattern of this dinner. Each day,
      I might almost say each meal, gave rise to the same sequence of thoughts.
      In Clon&rsquo;s presence, or when some word of Madame&rsquo;s, unconsciously harsh,
      reminded me of the distance between us, I was myself. At other times, in
      face of this peaceful and intimate life, which was only rendered possible
      by the remoteness of the place and the peculiar circumstances in which the
      ladies stood, I felt a strange weakness, The loneliness of the woods that
      encircled the house, and only here and there afforded a distant glimpse of
      snow-clad peaks; the absence of any link to bind me to the old life, so
      that at intervals it seemed unreal; the remoteness of the great world, all
      tended to sap my will and weaken the purpose which had brought me to this
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day after my coming, however, something happened to break
      the spell. It chanced that I came late to dinner, and entered the room
      hastily and without ceremony, expecting to find Madame and her sister
      already seated. Instead, I found them talking in a low tone by the open
      door, with every mark of disorder in their appearance; while Clon and
      Louis stood at a little distance with downcast faces and perplexed looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had time to see all this, and then my entrance wrought a sudden change.
      Clon and Louis sprang to attention; Madame and her sister came to the
      table and sat down, and all made a shallow pretence of being at their
      ease. But Mademoiselle&rsquo;s face was pale, her hand trembled; and though
      Madame&rsquo;s greater self-command enabled her to carry off the matter better,
      I saw that she was not herself. Once or twice she spoke harshly to Louis;
      she fell at other times into a brown study; and when she thought that I
      was not watching her, her face wore a look of deep anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what all this meant; and I wondered more when, after the meal,
      the two walked in the garden for an hour with Clon. Mademoiselle came from
      this interview alone, and I was sure that she had been weeping. Madame and
      the dark porter stayed outside some time longer; then she, too, came in,
      and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clon did not return with her, and when I went into the garden five minutes
      later, Louis also had vanished. Save for two women who sat sewing at an
      upper window, the house seemed to be deserted. Not a sound broke the
      afternoon stillness of room or garden, and yet I felt that more was
      happening in this silence than appeared on the surface. I begin to grow
      curious&mdash;suspicious, and presently slipped out myself by way of the
      stables, and skirting the wood at the back of the house, gained with a
      little trouble the bridge which crossed the stream and led to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning round at this point I could see the house, and I moved a little
      aside into the underwood, and stood gazing at the windows, trying to
      unriddle the matter. It was not likely that M. de Cocheforet would repeat
      his visit so soon; and, besides, the women&rsquo;s emotions had been those of
      pure dismay and grief, unmixed with any of the satisfaction to which such
      a meeting, though snatched by stealth, must give rise. I discarded my
      first thought therefore&mdash;that he had returned unexpectedly&mdash;and
      I sought for another solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no other was on the instant forthcoming. The windows remained
      obstinately blind, no figures appeared on the terrace, the garden lay
      deserted, and without life. My departure had not, as I half expected it
      would, drawn the secret into light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched awhile, at times cursing my own meanness; but the excitement of
      the moment and the quest tided me over that. Then I determined to go down
      into the village and see whether anything was moving there. I had been
      down to the inn once, and had been received half sulkily, half
      courteously, as a person privileged at the great house, and therefore to
      be accepted. It would not be thought odd if I went again, and after a
      moment&rsquo;s thought, I started down the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, where it ran through the wood, was so densely shaded that the sun
      penetrated to it little, and in patches only. A squirrel stirred at times,
      sliding round a trunk, or scampering across the dry leaves. Occasionally a
      pig grunted and moved farther into the wood. But the place was very quiet,
      and I do not know how it was that I surprised Clon instead of being
      surprised by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was walking along the path before me with his eyes on the ground&mdash;walking
      so slowly, and with his lean frame so bent that I might have supposed him
      ill if I had not remarked the steady movement of his head from right to
      left, and the alert touch with which he now and again displaced a clod of
      earth or a cluster of leaves. By-and-by he rose stiffly, and looked round
      him suspiciously; but by that time I had slipped behind a trunk, and was
      not to be seen; and after a brief interval he went back to his task,
      stooping over it more closely, if possible, than before, and applying
      himself with even greater care.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time I had made up my mind that he was tracking someone. But whom?
      I could not make a guess at that. I only knew that the plot was
      thickening, and began to feel the eagerness of the chase. Of course, if
      the matter had not to do with Cocheforet, it was no affair of mine; but
      though it seemed unlikely that anything could bring him back so soon, he
      might still be at the bottom of this. And, besides, I felt a natural
      curiosity. When Clon at last improved his pace, and went on to the
      village, I took up his task. I called to mind all the wood-lore I had ever
      learned, and scanned trodden mould and crushed leaves with eager eyes. But
      in vain. I could make nothing of it all, and rose at last with an aching
      back and no advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not go on to the village after that, but returned to the house,
      where I found Madame pacing the garden. She looked up eagerly on hearing
      my step; and I was mistaken if she was not disappointed&mdash;if she had
      not been expecting someone else. She hid the feeling bravely, however, and
      met me with a careless word; but she turned to the house more than once
      while we talked, and she seemed to be all the while on the watch, and
      uneasy. I was not surprised when Clon&rsquo;s figure presently appeared in the
      doorway, and she left me abruptly, and went to him. I only felt more
      certain than before that there was something strange on foot. What it was,
      and whether it had to do with M. de Cocheforet, I could not tell. But
      there it was, and I grew more curious the longer I remained alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back to me presently, looking thoughtful and a trifle downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was Clon, was it not?&rsquo; I said, studying her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered. She spoke absently, and did not look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does he talk to you?&rsquo; I asked, speaking a trifle curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I intended, my tone roused her. &lsquo;By signs,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he&mdash;is he not a little mad?&rsquo; I ventured. I wanted to make her
      talk and forget herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me with sudden keenness, then dropped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not like him?&rsquo; she said, a note of challenge in her voice. &lsquo;I have
      noticed that, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he does not like me,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is less trustful than we are,&rsquo; she answered naively. &lsquo;It is natural
      that he should be. He has seen more of the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That silenced me for a moment, but she did not seem to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was looking for him a little while ago, and I could not find him,&rsquo; I
      said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has been into the village,&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I longed to pursue the matter further; but though she seemed to entertain
      no suspicion of me, I dared not run the risk. I tried her, instead, on
      another tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle de Cocheforet does not seem very well to-day?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No?&rsquo; she answered carelessly. &lsquo;Well, now you speak of it, I do not think
      that she is. She is often anxious about&mdash;one we love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered the last words with a little hesitation, and looked at me
      quickly when she had spoken them. We were sitting at the moment on a stone
      seat which had the wall of the house for a back; and, fortunately, I was
      toying with the branch of a creeping plant that hung over it, so that she
      could not see more than the side of my face. For I knew that it altered.
      Over my voice, however, I had more control, and I hastened to answer,
      &lsquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rsquo; as innocently as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is at Bosost, in Spain. You knew that, I conclude?&rsquo; she said, with a
      certain sharpness. And she looked me in the face again very directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered, beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you have heard, too, that he&mdash;that he sometimes crosses
      the border?&rsquo; she continued in a low voice, but with a certain ring of
      insistence in her tone. &lsquo;Or, if you have not heard it, you guess it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in a quandary, and grew, in one second, hot all over. Uncertain what
      amount of knowledge I ought to admit, I took refuge in gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be surprised if he did not,&rsquo; I answered, with a bow, &lsquo;being, as
      he is, so close, and having such an inducement to return, Madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long, shivering sigh, at the thought of his peril, I fancied,
      and she sat back against the wall. Nor did she say any more, though I
      heard her sigh again. In a moment she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The afternoons are growing chilly,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I will go in and see how
      Mademoiselle is. Sometimes she does not come to supper. If she cannot
      descend this evening, I am afraid that you must excuse me too, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said what was right, and watched her go in; and, as I did so, I loathed
      my errand, and the mean contemptible curiosity which it had planted in my
      mind, more than at any former time. These women&mdash;I could find it in
      my heart to hate them for their frankness, for their foolish confidence,
      and the silly trustfulness that made them so easy a prey!
    </p>
    <p>
      NOM DE DIEU! What did the woman mean by telling me all this? To meet me in
      such a way, to disarm one by such methods, was to take an unfair
      advantage. It put a vile&mdash;ay, the vilest&mdash;aspect, on the work I
      had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was very odd! What could M. de Cocheforet mean by returning so
      soon, if M. de Cocheforet was here? And, on the other hand, if it was not
      his unexpected presence that had so upset the house, what was the secret?
      Whom had Clon been tracking? And what was the cause of Madame&rsquo;s anxiety?
      In a few minutes I began to grow curious again; and, as the ladies did not
      appear at supper, I had leisure to give my brain full licence, and, in the
      course of an hour, thought of a hundred keys to the mystery. But none
      exactly fitted the lock, or laid open the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      A false alarm that evening helped to puzzle me still more. I was sitting
      about an hour after supper, on the same seat in the garden&mdash;I had my
      cloak and was smoking&mdash;when Madame came out like a ghost, and,
      without seeing me, flitted away through the darkness toward the stables.
      For a moment I hesitated, and then I followed her. She went down the path
      and round the stables, and, so far, I saw nothing strange in her actions;
      but when she had in this way gained the rear of the west wing, she took a
      track through the thicket to the east of the house again, and so came back
      to the garden. This gained, she came up the path and went in through the
      parlour door, and disappeared&mdash;alter making a clear circuit of the
      house, and not once pausing or looking to right or left! I confess I was
      fairly baffled. I sank back on the seat I had left, and said to myself
      that this was the lamest of all conclusions. I was sure that she had
      exchanged no word with anyone. I was equally sure that she had not
      detected my presence behind her. Why, then, had she made this strange
      promenade, alone, unprotected, an hour after nightfall? No dog had bayed,
      no one had moved, she had not once paused, or listened, like a person
      expecting a rencontre. I could not make it out. And I came no nearer to
      solving it, though I lay awake an hour beyond my usual time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, neither of the ladies descended to dinner, and I heard
      that Mademoiselle was not so well. After a lonely meal, therefore I missed
      them more than I should have supposed&mdash;I retired to my favourite seat
      and fell to meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was fine, and the garden pleasant. Sitting there with my eyes on
      the old fashioned herb-beds, with the old-fashioned scents in the air, and
      the dark belt of trees bounding the view on either side, I could believe
      that I had been out of Paris not three weeks, but three months. The quiet
      lapped me round. I could fancy that I had never loved anything else. The
      wood-doves cooed in the stillness; occasionally the harsh cry of a jay
      jarred the silence. It was an hour after noon, and hot. I think I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sudden, as if in a dream, I saw Clon&rsquo;s face peering at me round the
      angle of the parlour door. He looked, and in a moment withdrew, and I
      heard whispering. The door was gently closed. Then all was still again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was wide awake now, and thinking. Clearly the people of the house
      wished to assure themselves that I was asleep and safely out of the way.
      As clearly, it was to my interest to be in the way. Giving place to the
      temptation, I rose quietly, and, stooping below the level of the windows,
      slipped round the east end of the house, passing between it and the great
      yew hedge. Here I found all still and no one stirring; so, keeping a wary
      eye about me, I went on round the house&mdash;reversing the route which
      Madame had taken the night before&mdash;until I gained the rear of the
      stables. Here I had scarcely paused a second to scan the ground before two
      persons came out of the stable-court. They were Madame and the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood a brief while outside and looked up and down. Then Madame said
      something to the man, and he nodded. Leaving him standing where he was,
      she crossed the grass with a quick, light step, and vanished among the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment my mind was made up to follow; and, as Clon turned at once and
      went in, I was able to do so before it was too late. Bending low among the
      shrubs, I ran hotfoot to the point where Madame had entered the wood. Here
      I found a narrow path, and ran nimbly along it, and presently saw her grey
      robe fluttering among the trees before me. It only remained to keep out of
      her sight and give her no chance of discovering that she was followed; and
      this I set myself to do. Once or twice she glanced round, but the wood was
      of beech, the light which passed between the leaves was mere twilight, and
      my clothes were dark-coloured. I had every advantage, therefore, and
      little to fear as long as I could keep her in view and still remain myself
      at such a distance that the rustle of my tread would not disturb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assured that she was on her way to meet her husband, whom my presence kept
      from the house, I felt that the crisis had come at last, and I grew more
      excited with each step I took. I detested the task of watching her; it
      filled me with peevish disgust. But in proportion as I hated it I was
      eager to have it done and be done with it, and succeed, and stuff my ears
      and begone from the scene. When she presently came to the verge of the
      beech wood, and, entering a little open clearing, seemed to loiter, I went
      cautiously. This, I thought, must be the rendezvous; and I held back
      warily, looking to see him step out of the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not, and by-and-by she quickened her pace. She crossed the open
      and entered a wide ride cut through a low, dense wood of alder and dwarf
      oak&mdash;a wood so closely planted and so intertwined with hazel and
      elder and box that the branches rose like a solid wall, twelve feet high,
      on either side of the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down this she passed, and I stood and watched her go, for I dared not
      follow. The ride stretched away as straight as a line for four or five
      hundred yards, a green path between green walls. To enter it was to be
      immediately detected, if she turned, while the thicket itself permitted no
      passage. I stood baffled and raging, and watched her pass along. It seemed
      an age before she at last reached the end, and, turning sharply to the
      right, was in an instant gone from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited then no longer. I started off, and, running as lightly and
      quietly as I could, I sped down the green alley. The sun shone into it,
      the trees kept off the wind, and between heat and haste I sweated finely.
      But the turf was soft, and the ground fell slightly, and in little more
      than a minute I gained the end. Fifty yards short of the turning I
      stopped, and, stealing on, looked cautiously the way she had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw before me a second ride, the twin of the other, and a hundred and
      fifty paces down it her grey figure tripping on between the green hedges.
      I stood and took breath, and cursed the wood and the heat and Madame&rsquo;s
      wariness. We must have come a league, or two-thirds of a league, at least.
      How far did the man expect her to plod to meet him? I began to grow angry.
      There is moderation even in the cooking of eggs, and this wood might
      stretch into Spain, for all I knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she turned the corner and was gone again, and I had to repeat my
      manoeuvre. This time, surely, I should find a change. But no! Another
      green ride stretched away into the depths of the forest, with hedges of
      varying shades&mdash;here light and there dark, as hazel and elder, or
      thorn, and yew and box prevailed&mdash;but always high and stiff and
      impervious. Halfway down the ride Madame&rsquo;s figure tripped steadily on, the
      only moving thing in sight. I wondered, stood, and, when she vanished,
      followed-only to find that she had entered another track, a little
      narrower but in every other respect alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it went on for quite half an hour. Sometimes Madame turned to the
      right, sometimes to the left. The maze seemed to be endless. Once or twice
      I wondered whether she had lost her way, and was merely seeking to return.
      But her steady, purposeful gait, her measured pace, forbade the idea. I
      noticed, too, that she seldom looked behind her&mdash;rarely to right or
      left. Once the ride down which she passed was carpeted not with green, but
      with the silvery, sheeny leaves of some creeping plant that in the
      distance had a shimmer like that of water at evening. As she trod this,
      with her face to the low sun, her tall grey figure had a pure air that for
      the moment startled me&mdash;she looked unearthly. Then I swore in scorn
      of myself, and at the next corner I had my reward. She was no longer
      walking on. She had stopped, I found, and seated herself on a fallen tree
      that lay in the ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time I stood in ambush watching her, and with each minute I grew
      more impatient. At last I began to doubt&mdash;to have strange thoughts.
      The green walls were growing dark. The sun was sinking; a sharp, white
      peak, miles and miles away, which closed the vista of the ride, began to
      flush and colour rosily. Finally, but not before I had had leisure to grow
      uneasy, she stood up and walked on more slowly. I waited, as usual, until
      the next turning hid her. Then I hastened after her, and, warily passing
      round the corner came face to face with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew all in a moment saw all in a flash: that she had fooled me, tricked
      me, lured me away. Her face was white with scorn, her eyes blazed; her
      figure, as she confronted me, trembled with anger and infinite contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You spy!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;You hound! You&mdash;gentleman! Oh, MON DIEU! if
      you are one of us&mdash;if you are really not of the CANAILLE&mdash;we
      shall pay for this some day! We shall pay a heavy reckoning in the time to
      come! I did not think,&rsquo; she continued, and her every syllable was like the
      lash of a whip, &lsquo;that there was anything so vile as you in this world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stammered something&mdash;I do not know what. Her words burned into me&mdash;into
      my heart! Had she been a man, I would have struck her dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thought that you deceived me yesterday,&rsquo; she continued, lowering her
      tone, but with no lessening of the passion, the contempt, the indignation,
      which curled her lip and gave fullness to her voice. &lsquo;You plotter! You
      surface trickster! You thought it an easy task to delude a woman&mdash;you
      find yourself deluded. God give you shame that you may suffer!&rsquo; she
      continued mercilessly. &lsquo;You talked of Clon, but Clon beside you is the
      most spotless, the most honourable of men!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; I said hoarsely&mdash;and I know that my face was grey as ashes&mdash;&lsquo;let
      us understand one another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; she cried on the instant. &lsquo;I would not soil myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fie! Madame,&rsquo; I said, trembling. But then, you are a woman. That should
      cost a man his life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say well,&rsquo; she retorted. &lsquo;I am not a man&mdash;and if you are one,
      thank God for it. Neither am I Madame. Madame de Cocheforet has spent this
      afternoon&mdash;thanks to your absence and your imbecility&mdash;with her
      husband. Yes, I hope that hurts you!&rsquo; she went on, savagely snapping her
      little white teeth together. &lsquo;I hope that stings you; to spy and do vile
      work, and do it ill, Monsieur Mouchard&mdash;Monsieur de Mouchard, I
      should say&mdash;I congratulate you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not Madame de Cocheforet?&rsquo; I cried, stunned, even in the midst of
      my shame and rage, by this blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Monsieur!&rsquo; she answered grimly. &lsquo;I am not! I am not. And permit me to
      point out&mdash;for we do not all lie easily&mdash;that I never said I
      was. You deceived yourself so skilfully that we had no need to trick you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle, then?&rsquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Madame!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Yes, and I am Mademoiselle de Cocheforet. And in
      that character, and in all others, I beg from this moment to close our
      acquaintance, sir. When we meet again&mdash;if we ever do meet, which God
      forbid!&rsquo; she went on, her eyes sparkling&mdash;&lsquo;do not presume to speak to
      me, or I will have you flogged by the grooms. And do not stain our roof by
      sleeping under it again. You may lie to-night in the inn. It shall not be
      said that Cocheforet,&rsquo; she continued proudly, &lsquo;returned even treachery
      with inhospitality; and I will give orders to that end. But to-morrow
      begone back to your master, like the whipped cur you are! Spy and coward!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those last words she moved away. I would have said something, I could
      almost have found it in my heart to stop her and make her hear. Nay, I had
      dreadful thoughts; for I was the stronger, and I might have done with her
      as I pleased. But she swept by me so fearlessly, as I might pass some
      loathsome cripple on the road, that I stood turned to stone. Without
      looking at me, without turning her head to see whether I followed or
      remained, or what I did, she went steadily down the track until the trees
      and the shadow and the growing darkness hid her grey figure from me; and I
      found myself alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. REVENGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      And full of black rage! Had she only reproached me, or, turning on me in
      the hour of MY victory, said all that she had now said in the moment of
      her own, I could have borne it. She might have shamed me then, and I might
      have taken the shame to myself and forgiven her. But, as it was, I stood
      there in the gathering dusk, between the darkening hedges, baffled,
      tricked, defeated! And by a woman! She had pitted her wits against mine,
      her woman&rsquo;s will against my experience, and she had come off the victor.
      And then she had reviled me! As I took it all in, and began to comprehend
      also the more remote results, and how completely her move had made further
      progress on my part impossible, I hated her. She had tricked me with her
      gracious ways and her slow-coming smile. And, after all&mdash;for what she
      had said&mdash;it was this man&rsquo;s life or mine. &lsquo;What had I done that
      another man would not do? MON DIEU! in the future there was nothing I
      would not do. I would make her smart for those words of hers! I would
      bring her to her knees!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, hot as I was, an hour might have restored me to coolness. But when
      I started to return, I fell into a fresh rage, for I remembered that I did
      not know my way out of the maze of rides and paths into which she had
      drawn me; and this and the mishaps which followed, kept my rage hot. For a
      full hour I wandered in the wood, unable, though I knew where the village
      lay, to find any track which led continuously in one direction. Whenever,
      at the end of each attempt, the thicket brought me up short, I fancied
      that I heard her laughing on the farther side of the brake; and the
      ignominy of this chance punishment, and the check which the confinement
      placed on my rage, almost maddened me. In the darkness I fell, and rose
      cursing; I tore my hands with thorns; I stained my suit, which had
      suffered sadly once before. At length, when I had almost resigned myself
      to lie in the wood, I caught sight of the lights of the village, and,
      trembling between haste and anger, pressed towards them. In a few minutes
      I stood in the little street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights of the inn shone only fifty yards away; but before I could show
      myself even there pride suggested that I should do something to repair my
      clothes. I stopped, and scraped and brushed them; and, at the same time,
      did what I could to compose my features. Then I advanced to the door and
      knocked. Almost on the instant the landlord&rsquo;s voice cried from the inside,
      &lsquo;Enter, Monsieur!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised the latch and went in. The man was alone, squatting over the fire
      warming his hands. A black pot simmered on the ashes, As I entered he
      raised the lid and peeped inside. Then he glanced over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You expected me?&rsquo; I said defiantly, walking to the hearth, and setting
      one of my damp boots on the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, nodding curtly. &lsquo;Your supper is just ready. I thought
      that you would be in about this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned as he spoke, and it was with difficulty I suppressed my wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle de Cocheforet told you,&rsquo; I said, affecting indifference,
      &lsquo;where I was?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, Mademoiselle&mdash;or Madame,&rsquo; he replied, grinning afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she had told him; where she had left me, and how she had tricked me!
      She had, made me the village laughing-stock! My rage flashed out afresh at
      the thought, and, at the sight of his mocking face, I raised my fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he read the threat in my eyes, and was up in a moment, snarling, with
      his hand on his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not again, Monsieur!&rsquo; he cried, in his vile patois. &lsquo;My head is sore
      still raise your hand and I will rip you up as I would a pig!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down, fool,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I am not going to harm you. Where is your
      wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About her business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which should be getting my supper,&rsquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose sullenly, and, fetching a platter, poured the mess of broth and
      vegetables into it. Then he went to a cupboard and brought out a loaf of
      black bread and a measure of wine, and set them also on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see it,&rsquo; he said laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a poor welcome!&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flamed into sudden passion at that. Leaning with both his hands on the
      table he thrust his rugged face and blood-shot eyes close to mine. His
      moustachios bristled, his beard trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark ye, sirrah!&rsquo; he muttered, with sullen emphasis, &lsquo;be content! I have
      my suspicions. And if it were not for my lady&rsquo;s orders I would put a knife
      into you, fair or foul, this very night. You would lie snug outside,
      instead of inside, and I do not think anyone would be the worse. But as it
      is, be content. Keep a still tongue; and when you turn your back on
      Cocheforet to-morrow keep it turned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut! tut!&rsquo; I said&mdash;but I confess that I was a little out of
      countenance. &lsquo;Threatened men live long, you rascal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Paris!&rsquo; he answered significantly. &lsquo;Not here, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened himself with that, nodded once, and went back to the fire;
      and I shrugged my shoulders and began to eat, affecting to forget his
      presence. The logs on the hearth burned sullenly, and gave no light. The
      poor oil-lamp, casting weird shadows from wall to wall, served only to
      discover the darkness. The room, with its low roof and earthen floor, and
      foul clothes flung here and there, reeked of stale meals and garlic and
      vile cooking. I thought of the parlour at Cocheforet, and the dainty
      table, and the stillness, and the scented pot-herbs; and though I was too
      old a soldier to eat the worse because my spoon lacked washing, I felt the
      change, and laid it savagely at Mademoiselle&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord, watching me stealthily from his place by the hearth, read my
      thoughts and chuckled aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Palace fare, palace manners!&rsquo; he muttered scornfully. &lsquo;Set a beggar on
      horseback, and he will ride&mdash;back to the inn!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep a civil tongue, will you!&rsquo; I answered, scowling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you finished?&rsquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose, without deigning to reply, and, going to the fire, drew off my
      boots, which were wet through. He, on the instant, swept off the wine and
      loaf to the cupboard, and then, coming back for the platter I had used,
      took it, opened the back door, and went out, leaving the door ajar. The
      draught which came in beat the flame of the lamp this way and that, and
      gave the dingy, gloomy room an air still more miserable. I rose angrily
      from the fire, and went to the door, intending to close it with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I reached it, I saw something, between door and jamb, which
      stayed my hand. The door led to a shed in which the housewife washed pots
      and the like. I felt some surprise, therefore, when I found a light there
      at this time of night; still more surprise when I saw what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated on the mud floor, with a rush-light before her, and on
      either side of her a high-piled heap of refuse and rubbish. From one of
      these, at the moment I caught sight of her, she was sorting things&mdash;horrible
      filthy sweepings of road or floor&mdash;to the other; shaking and sifting
      each article as she passed it across, and then taking up another and
      repeating the action with it, and so on&mdash;all minutely, warily, with
      an air of so much patience and persistence that I stood wondering. Some
      things&mdash;rags&mdash;she held up between her eyes and the light, some
      she passed through her fingers, some she fairly tore in pieces. And all
      the time her husband stood watching her greedily, my platter still in his
      hand, as if her strange occupation fascinated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood looking, also, for half a minute, perhaps; then the man&rsquo;s eye,
      raised for a single second to the door-way, met mine. He started, muttered
      something to his wife, and, quick as thought, he kicked the light out,
      leaving the shed in darkness. Cursing him for an ill-conditioned fellow, I
      walked back to the fire, laughing. In a twinkling he followed me, his face
      dark with rage. &lsquo;VENTRE-SAINT-GRIS!&rsquo; he exclaimed, thrusting himself close
      to me. &lsquo;Is not a man&rsquo;s house his own?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, for me,&rsquo; I answered coolly, shrugging my shoulders. &lsquo;And his wife:
      if she likes to pick dirty rags at this hour, that is your affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pig of a spy!&rsquo; he cried, foaming with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was angry enough at bottom, but I had nothing to gain by quarrelling
      with the fellow; and I curtly bade him remember himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mistress gave you orders,&rsquo; I said contemptuously. &lsquo;Obey them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spat on the floor, but at the same time he grew calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right there,&rsquo; he answered spitefully. &lsquo;What matter, after all,
      since you leave to-morrow at six? Your horse has been sent down, and your
      baggage is above.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go to it,&rsquo; I retorted. &lsquo;I want none of your company. Give me a
      light, fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed reluctantly, and, glad to turn my back on him, I went up the
      ladder, still wondering faintly, in the midst of my annoyance, what his
      wife was about that my chance detection of her had so enraged him. Even
      now he was not quite himself. He followed me with abuse, and, deprived by
      my departure of any other means of showing his spite, fell to shouting
      through the floor, bidding me remember six o&rsquo;clock, and be stirring; with
      other taunts, which did not cease until he had tired himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of my belongings&mdash;which I had left a few hours before at
      the Chateau&mdash;strewn about the floor of this garret, went some way
      towards firing me again. But I was worn out. The indignities and mishaps
      of the evening had, for once, crushed my spirit, and after swearing an
      oath or two I began to pack my bags. Vengeance I would have; but the time
      and manner I left for daylight thought. Beyond six o&rsquo;clock in the morning
      I did not look forward; and if I longed for anything it was for a little
      of the good Armagnac I had wasted on those louts of merchants in the
      kitchen below. It might have done me good now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had wearily strapped up one bag, and nearly filled the other, when I
      came upon something which did, for the moment, rouse the devil in me. This
      was the tiny orange-coloured sachet which Mademoiselle had dropped the
      night I first saw her at the inn, and which, it will be remembered, I
      picked up. Since that night I had not seen it, and had as good as
      forgotten it. Now, as I folded up my other doublet, the one I had then
      been wearing, it dropped from my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of it recalled all&mdash;that night, and Mademoiselle&rsquo;s face in
      the lantern light, and my fine plans, and the end of them; and, in a fit
      of childish fury, the outcome of long suppressed passion, I snatched up
      the sachet from the floor and tore it across and across, and flung the
      pieces down. As they fell, a cloud of fine pungent dust burst from them,
      and with the dust, something more solid, which tinkled sharply on the
      boards, as it fell. I looked down to see what this was&mdash;perhaps I
      already repented of my act; but for a moment I could see nothing. The
      floor was grimy and uninviting, the light bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain moods, however, a man is obstinate about small things, and I
      moved the taper nearer. As I did so a point of light, a flashing sparkle
      that shone for a second among the dirt and refuse on the floor, caught my
      eye. It was gone in a moment, but I had seen it. I stared, and moved the
      light again, and the spark flashed out afresh, this time in a different
      place. Much puzzled, I knelt, and, in a twinkling, found a tiny crystal.
      Hard by it lay another&mdash;and another; each as large as a fair-sized
      pea. I took up the three, and rose to my feet again, the light in one
      hand, the crystals in the palm of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were diamonds! Diamonds of price! I knew it in a moment. As I moved
      the taper to and fro above them, and watched the fire glow and tremble in
      their depths, I knew that I held in my hand that which would buy the crazy
      inn and all its contents a dozen times over! They were diamonds! Gems so
      fine, and of so rare a water&mdash;or I had never seen gems&mdash;that my
      hand trembled as I held them, and my head grew hot and my heart beat
      furiously. For a moment I thought that I dreamed, that my fancy played me
      some trick; and I closed my eyes and did not open them again for a minute.
      But when I did, there they were, hard, real, and angular. Convinced at
      last, in a maze of joy and fear, I closed my hand upon them, and, stealing
      on tip-toe to the trap-door, laid first my saddle on it and then my bags,
      and over all my cloak, breathing fast the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I stole back, and, taking up the light again, began to search the
      floor, patiently, inch by inch, with naked feet, every sound making me
      tremble as I crept hither and thither over the creaking boards. And never
      was search more successful or better paid. In the fragments of the sachet
      I found six smaller diamonds and a pair of rubies. Eight large diamonds I
      found on the floor. One, the largest and last found, had bounded away, and
      lay against the wall in the farthest corner. It took me an hour to run
      that one to earth; but afterwards I spent another hour on my hands and
      knees before I gave up the search, and, satisfied at last that I had
      collected all, sat down on my saddle on the trap-door, and, by the last
      flickering light of a candle which I had taken from my bag, gloated over
      my treasure&mdash;a treasure worthy of fabled Golconda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly could I believe in its reality, even now. Recalling the jewels
      which the English Duke of Buckingham wore on the occasion of his visit to
      Paris in 1625, and whereof there was so much talk, I took these to be as
      fine, though less in number. They should be worth fifteen thousand crowns,
      more or less. Fifteen thousand crowns! And I held them in the hollow of my
      hand&mdash;I, who was scarcely worth ten thousand sous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle going out cut short my admiration. Left in the dark with these
      precious atoms, my first thought was how I might dispose of them safely;
      which I did, for the time, by secreting them in the lining of my boot. My
      second thought turned on the question how they had come where I had found
      them, among the powdered spice and perfumes in Mademoiselle de
      Cocheforet&rsquo;s sachet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute&rsquo;s reflection enabled me to come very near the secret, and at the
      same time shed a flood of light on several dark places, What Clon had been
      seeking on the path between the house and the village, what the goodwife
      of the inn had sought among the sweepings of yard and floor, I knew now
      the sachet&mdash;knew, too, what had caused the marked and sudden anxiety
      I had noticed at the Chateau&mdash;the loss of this sachet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there for a while I came to a check But one step more up the ladder of
      thought brought all in view. In a flash I guessed how the jewels had come
      to be in the sachet; and that it was not Mademoiselle but M. de Cocheforet
      who had mislaid them. I thought this last discovery so important that I
      began to pace the room softly, unable, in my excitement, to remain still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless he had dropped the jewels in the hurry of his start from the inn
      that night! Doubtless, too, he had carried them in that bizarre
      hiding-place for the sake of safety, considering it unlikely that robbers,
      if he fell into their hands, would take the sachet from him; as still less
      likely that they would suspect it to contain anything of value. Everywhere
      it would pass for a love-gift, the work of his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did my penetration stop there. I guessed that the gems were family
      property, the last treasure of the house; and that M. de Cocheforet, when
      I saw him at the inn, was on his way to convey them out of the country;
      either to secure them from seizure by the Government, or to raise money by
      selling them&mdash;money to be spent in some last desperate enterprise.
      For a day or two, perhaps, after leaving Cocheforet, while the mountain
      road and its chances occupied his thoughts, he had not discovered his
      loss. Then he had searched for the precious sachet, missed it, and
      returned hot-foot on his tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longer I considered the circumstances the more certain I was that I
      had hit on the true solution; and all that night I sat wakeful in the
      darkness, pondering what I should do. The stones, unset as they were,
      could never be identified, never be claimed. The channel by which they had
      come to my hands could never be traced. To all intents they were mine;
      mine, to do with as I pleased! Fifteen thousand crowns, perhaps twenty
      thousand crowns, and I to leave at six in the morning, whether I would or
      no! I might leave for Spain with the jewels in my pocket. Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess I was tempted. And indeed the gems were so fine that I doubt not
      some indifferently honest men would have sold salvation for them. But&mdash;a
      Berault his honour? No. I was tempted, I say; but not for long. Thank God,
      a man may be reduced to living by the fortunes of the dice, and may even
      be called by a woman &lsquo;spy&rsquo; and &lsquo;coward,&rsquo; without becoming a thief! The
      temptation soon left me&mdash;I take credit for it&mdash;and I fell to
      thinking of this and that plan for making use of them. Once it occurred to
      me to take the jewels to the Cardinal and buy my pardon with them; again,
      to use them as a trap to capture Cocheforet; again, to&mdash;and then,
      about five in the morning, as I sat up on my wretched pallet, while the
      first light stole slowly in through the cobwebbed, hay-stuffed lattice,
      there came to me the real plan, the plan of plans, on which I acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It charmed me I smacked my lips over it, and hugged myself, and felt my
      eyes dilate in the darkness, as I conned it. It seemed cruel, it seemed
      mean; I cared nothing. Mademoiselle had boasted of her victory over me, of
      her woman&rsquo;s wits and her acuteness and of my dullness. She had said that
      her grooms should flog me. She had rated me as if I had been a dog. Very
      well; we would see now whose brains were the better, whose was the master
      mind, whose should be the whipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing required by my plan was that I should get speech with her;
      that done, I could trust myself and my new-found weapon for the rest. But
      that was absolutely necessary, and, seeing that there might be some
      difficulty about it, I determined to descend as if my mind were made up to
      go; then, on pretence of saddling my horse, I would slip away on foot, and
      lie in wait near the Chateau until I saw her come out. Or if I could not
      effect my purpose in that way&mdash;either by reason of the landlord&rsquo;s
      vigilance, or for any other cause&mdash;my course was still easy. I would
      ride away, and when I had proceeded a mile or so, tie up my horse in the
      forest and return to the wooden bridge. Thence I could watch the garden
      and front of the Chateau until time and chance gave me the opportunity I
      sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I saw my way quite clearly; and when the fellow below called me,
      reminding me rudely that I must be going, and that it was six o&rsquo;clock, I
      was ready with my answer. I shouted sulkily that I was coming, and, after
      a decent delay, I took up my saddle and bags and went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed by the light of a cold morning, the inn-room looked more smoky,
      more grimy, more wretched than when I had last seen it. The goodwife was
      not visible. The fire was not lighted. No provision, not so much as a
      stirrup-cup or bowl of porridge cheered the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked round, sniffing the stale smell of last night&rsquo;s lamp, and
      grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to send me out fasting?&rsquo; I said, affecting a worse humour
      than I felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord was standing by the window, stooping over a great pair of
      frayed and furrowed thigh-boots which he was labouring to soften with
      copious grease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle ordered no breakfast,&rsquo; he answered, with a malicious grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well it does not much matter,&rsquo; I replied grandly. &lsquo;I shall be at Auch by
      noon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is as may be,&rsquo; he answered with another grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not understand him, but I had something else to think about, and I
      opened the door and stepped out, intending to go to the stable. Then in a
      second I comprehended. The cold air laden with woodland moisture met me
      and went to my bones; but it was not that which made me shiver. Outside
      the door, in the road, sitting on horseback in silence, were two men. One
      was Clon. The other, who had a spare horse by the rein&mdash;my horse&mdash;was
      a man I had seen at the inn, a rough, shock-headed, hard-bitten fellow.
      Both were armed, and Clon was booted. His mate rode barefoot, with a rusty
      spur strapped to one heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I saw them a sure and certain fear crept into my mind: it was
      that which made me shiver. But I did not speak to them. I went in again
      and closed the door behind me. The landlord was putting on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does this mean?&rsquo; I said hoarsely&mdash;though I had a clear
      prescience of what was coming. &lsquo;Why are these men here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Orders,&rsquo; he answered laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose orders?&rsquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose?&rsquo; he answered bluntly. &lsquo;Well, Monsieur, that is my business. Enough
      that we mean to see you out of the country, and out of harm&rsquo;s way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if I will not go?&rsquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur will go,&rsquo; he answered coolly. &lsquo;There are no strangers in the
      village to-day,&rsquo; he added, with a significant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to kidnap me?&rsquo; I replied, in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But behind the rage was something else&mdash;I will not call it terror,
      for the brave feel no terror but it was near akin to it. I had had to do
      with rough men all my life, but there was a grimness and truculence in the
      aspect of these three that shook me. When I thought of the dark paths and
      narrow lanes and cliff sides we must traverse, whichever road we took, I
      trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kidnap you, Monsieur?&rsquo; he answered, with an every-day air. &lsquo;That is as
      you please to call it. One thing is certain, however,&rsquo; he continued,
      maliciously touching an arquebuss which he had brought out, and set
      upright against a chair while I was at the door; if you attempt the
      slightest resistance, we shall know how to put an end to it, either here
      or on the road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew a deep breath, the very imminence of the danger restoring me to the
      use of my faculties. I changed my tone and laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So that is your plan, is it?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;The sooner we start the better,
      then. And the sooner I see Auch and your back turned, the more I shall be
      pleased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose. &lsquo;After you, Monsieur,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not restrain a slight shiver. His new-born politeness alarmed me
      more than his threats. I knew the man and his ways, and I was sure that it
      boded ill to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had no pistols, and only my sword and knife, and I knew that
      resistance at this point must be worse than vain. I went out jauntily,
      therefore, the landlord coming after me with my saddle and bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street was empty, save for the two waiting horsemen who sat in their
      saddles looking doggedly before them, The sun had not yet risen, the air
      was raw. The sky was grey, cloudy, and cold. My thoughts flew back to the
      morning on which I had found the sachet&mdash;at that very spot, almost at
      that very hour, and for a moment I grew warm again at the thought of the
      little packet I carried in my boot. But the landlord&rsquo;s dry manner, the
      sullen silence of his two companions, whose eyes steadily refused to meet
      mine, chilled me again. For an instant the impulse to refuse to mount, to
      refuse to go, was almost irresistible; then, knowing the madness of such a
      course, which might, and probably would, give the men the chance they
      desired, I crushed it down and went slowly to my stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder you do not want my sword,&rsquo; I said by way of sarcasm, as I swung
      myself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are not afraid of it,&rsquo; the innkeeper answered gravely. &lsquo;You may keep
      it&mdash;for the present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer&mdash;what answer had I to make?&mdash;and we rode at a
      footpace down the street; he and I leading, Clon and the shock-headed man
      bringing up the rear. The leisurely mode of our departure, the absence of
      hurry or even haste, the men&rsquo;s indifference whether they were seen, or
      what was thought, all served to sink my spirits and deepen my sense of
      peril. I felt that they suspected me, that they more than half guessed the
      nature of my errand at Cocheforet, and that they were not minded to be
      bound by Mademoiselle&rsquo;s orders. In particular, I augured the worst from
      Clon&rsquo;s appearance. His lean malevolent face and sunken eyes, his very
      dumbness chilled me. Mercy had no place there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rode soberly, so that nearly half an hour elapsed before we gained the
      brow from which I had taken my first look at Cocheforet. Among the dwarf
      oaks whence I had viewed the valley we paused to breathe our horses, and
      the strange feelings with which I looked back on the scene may be
      imagined. But I had short time for indulging in sentiment or
      recollections. A curt word, and we were moving again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of a mile farther on, the road to Auch dipped into the valley.
      When we were already half way down this descent the innkeeper suddenly
      stretched out his hand and caught my rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way!&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that he would have me turn into a by-path leading south-westwards&mdash;a
      mere track, faint and little trodden and encroached on by trees, which led
      I knew not whither. I checked my horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; I said rebelliously. &lsquo;Do you think I do not know the road? The road
      we are in is the way to Auch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Auch&mdash;yes,&rsquo; he answered bluntly. &lsquo;But we are not going to Auch,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whither then?&rsquo; I said angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see presently,&rsquo; he replied with an ugly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but I will know now!&rsquo; I retorted, passion getting the better of me.
      &lsquo;I have come so far with you. You will find it more easy to take me
      farther if you tell me your plans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a fool!&rsquo; he cried with a snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;I ask only to know whither I am going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Into Spain,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Will that satisfy you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what will you do with me there?&rsquo; I asked, my heart giving a great
      bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hand you over to some friends of ours,&rsquo; he answered curtly, &lsquo;if you
      behave yourself. If not, there is a shorter way, and one that will save us
      some travelling. Make up your mind, Monsieur. Which shall it be?&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      So that was their plan. Two or three hours to the southward, the long,
      white, glittering wall stretched east and west above the brown woods.
      Beyond that lay Spain. Once across the border, I might be detained, if no
      worse happened to me, as a prisoner of war; for we were then at war with
      Spain on the Italian side. Or I might be handed over to one of the savage
      bands, half smugglers, half brigands, that held the passes; or be
      delivered, worse fate of all, into the power of the French exiles, of whom
      some would be likely to recognise me and cut my throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a long way into Spain,&rsquo; I muttered, watching in a kind of
      fascination Clon handling his pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you will find the other road longer still,&rsquo; the landlord answered
      grimly. &lsquo;But choose, and be quick about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were three to one, and they had firearms. In effect I had no choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if I must I must?&rsquo; I cried, making up my mind with seeming
      recklessness. &lsquo;VOGUE LA GALERE! Spain be it. It will not be the first time
      I have heard the dons talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The men nodded, as much as to say that they had known what the end would
      be; the landlord released my rein; and in a trice we were riding down the
      narrow track, with our faces set towards the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one point my mind was now more easy. The men meant fairly by me, and I
      had no longer to fear, as I had feared, a pistol-shot in the back at the
      first convenient ravine. As far as that went, I might ride in peace. On
      the other hand, if I let them carry me across the border my fate was
      sealed. A man set down without credentials or guards among the wild
      desperadoes who swarmed in war-time in the Asturian passes might consider
      himself fortunate if an easy death fell to his lot. In my case I could
      make a shrewd guess what would happen. A single nod of meaning, one
      muttered word, dropped among the savage men with whom I should be left,
      and the diamonds hidden in my boot would go neither to the Cardinal nor
      back to Mademoiselle&mdash;nor would it matter to me whither they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      So while the others talked in their taciturn fashion, or sometimes grinned
      at my gloomy face, I looked out over the brown woods with eyes that saw
      yet did not see. The red squirrel swarming up the trunk, the startled pigs
      that rushed away grunting from their feast of mast, the solitary rider who
      met us, armed to the teeth, and passed northwards after whispering with
      the landlord&mdash;all these I saw. But my mind was not with them. It was
      groping and feeling about like a hunted mole for some way of escape. For
      time pressed. The slope we were on was growing steeper. By-and-by we fell
      into a southward valley, and began to follow it steadily upwards, crossing
      and recrossing a swiftly rushing stream. The snow peaks began to be hidden
      behind the rising bulk of hills that overhung us, and sometimes we could
      see nothing before or behind but the wooded walls of our valley rising
      sheer and green a thousand paces high on either hand; with grey rocks half
      masked by fern and ivy jutting here and there through the firs and alders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wild and sombre scene even at that hour, with the mid-day sun
      shining on the rushing water and drawing the scent out of the pines; but I
      knew that there was worse to come, and sought desperately for some ruse by
      which I might at least separate the men. Three were too many; with one I
      might deal. At last, when I had cudgelled my brain for an hour, and almost
      resigned myself to a sudden charge on the men single-handed&mdash;a last
      desperate resort&mdash;I thought of a plan: dangerous, too, and almost
      desperate, but which still seemed to promise something. It came of my
      fingers resting, as they lay in my pocket, on the fragments of the orange
      sachet; which, without having any particular design in my mind, I had
      taken care to bring with me. I had torn the sachet into four pieces&mdash;four
      corners. As I played mechanically with them, one of my fingers fitted into
      one, as into a glove; a second finger into another. And the plan came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could move in it, however, I had to wait until we stopped to bait
      the flagging horses, which we did about noon at the head of the valley.
      Then, pretending to drink from the stream, I managed to secure unseen a
      handful of pebbles, slipping them into the same pocket with the morsels of
      stuff. On getting to horse again, I carefully fitted a pebble, not too
      tightly, into the largest scrap, and made ready for the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord rode on my left, abreast of me; the other two knaves behind.
      The road at this stage favoured me, for the valley, which drained the bare
      uplands that lay between the lower hills and the base of the real
      mountains, had become wide and shallow. Here were no trees, and the path
      was a mere sheep-track covered with short, crisp grass, and running
      sometimes on this bank of the stream and sometimes on that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited until the ruffian beside me turned to speak to the men behind.
      The moment he did so, and his eyes were averted, I slipped out the scrap
      of satin in which I had placed the pebble, and balancing it carefully on
      my right thigh as I rode, I flipped it forward with all the strength of my
      thumb and finger. I meant it to fall a few paces before us in the path,
      where it could be seen. But alas for my hopes! At the critical moment my
      horse started, my finger struck the scrap aslant, the pebble flew out, and
      the bit of stuff fluttered into a whin-bush close to my stirrup&mdash;and
      was lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was bitterly disappointed, for the same thing might happen again, and I
      had now only three scraps left. But fortune favoured me, by putting it
      into my neighbour&rsquo;s head to plunge into a hot debate with the shock-headed
      man on the nature of some animals seen on a distant brow; which he said
      were izards, while the other maintained that they were common goats. He
      continued, on this account, to ride with his face turned from me, and I
      had time to fit another pebble into the second piece of stuff. Sliding it
      on to my thigh, I poised it, and flipped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time my finger struck the tiny missile fairly in the middle, and shot
      it so far and so truly that it dropped exactly in the path ten paces in
      front of us. The moment I saw it fall I kicked my neighbour&rsquo;s nag in the
      ribs; it started, and he, turning in a rage, hit it. The next instant he
      pulled it almost on to its haunches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SAINT GRIS!&rsquo; he cried; and sat glaring at the bit of yellow satin, with
      his face turned purple and his jaw fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it!&rsquo; I said, staring at him in turn, &lsquo;What is the matter, fool?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matter?&rsquo; he blurted out. &lsquo;MON DIEU!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clon&rsquo;s excitement surpassed even his. The dumb man no sooner saw what
      had attracted his comrade&rsquo;s attention, than he uttered an inarticulate and
      horrible noise, and tumbling off his horse, more like a beast than a man
      threw himself bodily on the precious morsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper was not far behind him. An instant and he was down, too,
      peering at the thing; and for an instant I thought that they would fight
      over it. However, though their jealousy was evident, their excitement
      cooled a little when they discovered that the scrap of stuff was empty;
      for, fortunately, the pebble had fallen out of it. Still, it threw them
      into such a fever of eagerness as it was wonderful to witness. They nosed
      the ground where it had lain, they plucked up the grass and turf, and
      passed it through their fingers, they ran to and fro like dogs on a trail;
      and, glancing askance at one another, came back always together to the
      point of departure. Neither in his jealousy would suffer the other to be
      there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock-headed man and I sat our horses and looked on; he marvelling,
      and I pretending to marvel. As the two searched up and down the path, we
      moved a little out of it to give them space; and presently, when all their
      heads were turned from me, I let a second morsel drop under a gorse-bush.
      The shock-headed man, by-and-by, found this, and gave it to Clon; and as
      from the circumstances of the first discovery no suspicion attached to me,
      I ventured to find the third and last scrap myself. I did not pick it up,
      but I called the innkeeper, and he pounced upon it as I have seen a hawk
      pounce on a chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hunted for the fourth morsel, but, of course, in vain, and in the end
      they desisted, and fitted the three they had together; but neither would
      let his own portion out of his hands, and each looked at the other across
      the spoil with eyes of suspicion. It was strange to see them in that
      wide-stretching valley, whence grey boar-backs of hills swelled up into
      the silence of the snow&mdash;it was strange, I say, in that vast
      solitude, to see these two, mere dots on its bosom, circling round one
      another in fierce forgetfulness of the outside world, glaring and shifting
      their ground like cocks about to engage, and wholly engrossed&mdash;by
      three scraps of orange-colour, invisible at fifty paces!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the innkeeper cried with an oath, &lsquo;I am going back. This must be
      known down yonder. Give me your pieces, man, and do you go on with
      Antoine. It will be all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clon, waving a scrap of the stuff in either hand, and thrusting his
      ghastly mask into the other&rsquo;s face, shook his head in passionate denial.
      He could not speak, but he made it as clear as daylight that if anyone
      went back with the news, he was the man to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; the landlord rejoined fiercely, &lsquo;We cannot leave Antoine to go
      on alone with him. Give me the stuff.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clon would not. He had no thought of resigning the credit of the
      discovery; and I began to think that the two would really come to blows.
      But there was an alternative&mdash;an alternative in which I was
      concerned; and first one and then the other looked at me. It was a moment
      of peril, and I knew it. My stratagem might react on myself, and the two,
      to put an end to their difficulty, agree to put an end to me. But I faced
      them so coolly, and showed so bold a front, and the ground where we stood
      was so open, that the idea took no root. They fell to wrangling again more
      viciously than before. One tapped his gun and the other his pistols. The
      landlord scolded, the dumb man gurgled. At last their difference ended as
      I had hoped it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well then, we will both go back!&rsquo; the innkeeper cried in a rage.
      &lsquo;And Antoine must see him on. But the blame be on your head. Do you give
      the lad your pistols.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clon took one pistol, and gave it to the shock-headed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other!&rsquo; the innkeeper said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clon shook his head with a grim smile, and pointed to the arquebuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a sudden movement, the landlord snatched the pistol, and averted Clon&rsquo;s
      vengeance by placing both it and the gun in the shock-headed man&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; he said, addressing the latter, &lsquo;now can you do? If Monsieur
      tries to escape or turn back, shoot him! But four hours&rsquo; riding should
      bring you to the Roca Blanca. You will find the men there, and will have
      no more to do with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine did not see things quite in that light, however. He looked at me,
      and then at the wild track in front of us; and he muttered an oath and
      said he would die if he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the landlord, who was in a frenzy of impatience, drew him aside and
      talked to him, and in the end seemed to persuade him; for in a few minutes
      the matter was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine came back, and said sullenly, &lsquo;Forward, Monsieur,&rsquo; the two others
      stood on one side, I shrugged my shoulders and kicked up my horse, and in
      a twinkling we two were riding on together&mdash;man to man. I turned once
      or twice to see what those we had left behind were doing, and always found
      them standing in apparent debate; but my guard showed so much jealousy of
      these movements that I presently shrugged my shoulders again and desisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had racked my brains to bring about this state of things. Strange to
      say, now I had succeeded, I found it less satisfactory than I had hoped. I
      had reduced the odds and got rid of my most dangerous antagonists; but
      Antoine, left to himself, proved to be as full of suspicion as an egg of
      meat. He rode a little behind me, with his gun across his saddlebow, and a
      pistol near his hand; and at the slightest pause on my part, or if I
      turned to look at him, he muttered his constant &lsquo;Forward, Monsieur!&rsquo; in a
      tone which warned me that his finger was on the trigger. At such a
      distance he could not miss; and I saw nothing for it but to go on meekly
      before him to the Roca Blanca&mdash;and my fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done? The road presently reached the end of the valley and
      entered a narrow pine-clad defile, strewn with rocks and boulders, over
      which the torrent plunged and eddied with a deafening roar. In front the
      white gleam of waterfalls broke the sombre ranks of climbing trunks. The
      snow line lay less than half a mile away on either hand; and crowning all&mdash;at
      the end of the pass, as it seemed to the eye&mdash;rose the pure white
      pillar of the Pic du Midi shooting up six thousand feet into the blue of
      heaven. Such a scene so suddenly disclosed, was enough to drive the sense
      of danger from my mind; and for a moment I reined in my horse. But
      &lsquo;Forward, Monsieur!&rsquo; came the grating order. I fell to earth again, and
      went on. What was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was at my wits&rsquo; end to know. The man refused to talk, refused to ride
      abreast of me, would have no dismounting, no halting, no communication at
      all. He would have nothing but this silent, lonely procession of two, with
      the muzzle of his gun at my back. And meanwhile we were fast climbing the
      pass. We had left the others an hour&mdash;nearly two. The sun was
      declining; the time, I supposed, about half-past three.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he would only let me come within reach of him! Or if anything would
      fall out to take his attention! When the pass presently widened into a
      bare and dreary valley, strewn with huge boulders and with snow lying here
      and there in the hollows, I looked desperately before me, and scanned even
      the vast snow-fields that overhung us and stretched away to the base of
      the ice-peak. But I saw nothing. No bear swung across the path, no izard
      showed itself on the cliffs. The keen, sharp air cut our cheeks and warned
      me that we were approaching the summit of the ridge. On all sides were
      silence and desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      MON DIEU! And the ruffians on whose tender mercies I was to be thrown
      might come to meet us! They might appear at any moment. In my despair I
      loosened my hat on my head, and let the first gust carry it to the ground,
      and then with an oath of annoyance tossed my feet from the stirrups to go
      after it. But the rascal roared to me to keep my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forward, Monsieur!&rsquo; he shouted brutally. &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But my hat!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;MILLE TONNERRES, man! I must&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forward, Monsieur, or I shoot!&rsquo; he replied inexorably raising his gun.
      &lsquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And I went on. But, ah, I was wrathful! That I, Gil de Berault, should be
      outwitted, and led by the nose like a ringed bull, by this Gascon lout!
      That I, whom all Paris knew and feared&mdash;if it did not love&mdash;the
      terror of Zaton&rsquo;s, should come to my end in this dismal waste of snow and
      rock, done to death by some pitiful smuggler or thief! It must not be.
      Surely in the last resort I could give an account of one man, though his
      belt were stuffed with pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how? Only, it seemed, by open force. My heart began to flutter as I
      planned it; and then grew steady again. A hundred paces before us a gully
      or ravine on the left ran up into the snow-field. Opposite its mouth a
      jumble of stones and broken rocks covered the path, I marked this for the
      place. The knave would need both his hands to hold up his nag over the
      stones, and, if I turned on him suddenly enough, he might either drop his
      gun or fire it harmlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the meantime, something happened; as, at the last moment, things
      do happen. While we were still fifty yards short of the place, I found his
      horse&rsquo;s nose creeping forward on a level with my crupper; and, still
      advancing, still advancing, until I could see it out of the tail of my
      eye, and my heart gave a great bound. He was coming abreast of me: he was
      going to deliver himself into my hands! To cover my excitement, I began to
      whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; he muttered fiercely, his voice sounding so strange and unnatural,
      that my first thought was that he was ill; and I turned to him. But he
      only said again,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! Pass by here quietly, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; I asked mutinously, curiosity getting the better of me. For had I
      been wise I had taken no notice; every second his horse was coming up with
      mine. Its nose was level with my stirrup already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, man!&rsquo; he said again. This time there was no mistake about the panic
      in his voice. &lsquo;They call this the Devil&rsquo;s Chapel, God send us safe by it!
      It is late to be here. Look at those!&rsquo; he continued, pointing with a
      finger which visibly shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked. At the mouth of the gully, in a small space partly cleared of
      stones, stood three broken shafts, raised on rude pedestals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I said in a low voice. The sun, which was near setting, flushed
      the great peak above to the colour of blood; but the valley was growing
      grey and each moment more dreary. &lsquo;Well, what of those?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my peril and the excitement of the coming struggle I felt the
      chill of his fear. Never had I seen so grim, so desolate, so God-forsaken
      a place! Involuntarily I shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were crosses,&rsquo; he muttered in a voice little above a whisper, while
      his eyes roved this way and that in terror. &lsquo;The Cure of Gabas blessed the
      place, and set them up. But next morning they were as you see them now.
      Come on, Monsieur; come on!&rsquo; he continued, plucking at my arm. &lsquo;It is not
      safe here after sunset. Pray God, Satan be not at home!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had completely forgotten in his panic that he had anything to fear from
      me. His gun dropped loosely across his saddle, his leg rubbed mine. I saw
      this, and I changed my plan of action. As our horses reached the stones I
      stooped, as if to encourage mine, and, with a sudden clutch, snatched the
      gun bodily from his hand, at the same time that I backed my horse with all
      my strength. It was done in a moment! A second and I had him at the end of
      the gun, and my finger was on the trigger. Never was victory more easily
      gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me between rage and terror, his jaw fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you mad?&rsquo; he cried, his teeth chattering as he spoke. Even in this
      strait his eyes left me and wandered round in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sane!&rsquo; I retorted fiercely. &lsquo;But I do not like this place any better
      than you do.&rsquo; Which was true enough, if not quite true. &lsquo;So, by your
      right, quick march!&rsquo; I continued imperatively. &lsquo;Turn your horse, my
      friend, or take the consequences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned like a lamb, and headed down the valley again, without giving a
      thought to his pistols. I kept close to him, and in less than a minute we
      had left the Devil&rsquo;s Chapel well behind us, and were moving down again as
      we had come up. Only now I held the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had gone have a mile or so&mdash;until then I did not feel
      comfortable myself, and though I thanked heaven that the place existed, I
      thanked heaven also that I was out of it&mdash;I bade him halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take off your belt,&rsquo; I said curtly, &lsquo;and throw it down. But, mark me, if
      you turn I fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit was quite gone out of him, and he obeyed mechanically. I jumped
      down, still covering him with the gun, and picked up the belt, pistols and
      all. Then I remounted, and we went on. By-and-by he asked me sullenly what
      I was going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go back,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and take the road to Auch when I come to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be dark in an hour,&rsquo; he answered sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; I retorted. &lsquo;We must camp and do the best we can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I said, we did. The daylight held until we gained the skirts of the
      pine-wood at the head of the pass. Here I chose a corner a little off the
      track, and well sheltered from the wind, and bade him light a fire. I
      tethered the horses near this and within sight. Then it remained only to
      sup. I had a piece of bread: he had another and an onion. We ate in
      silence, sitting on opposite sides of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after supper I found myself in a dilemma; I did not see how I was to
      sleep. The ruddy light which gleamed on the knave&rsquo;s swart face and sinewy
      hands showed also his eyes, black, sullen, and watchful. I knew that the
      man was plotting revenge; that he would not hesitate to plant his knife
      between my ribs should I give him the chance; and I could find only one
      alternative to remaining awake. Had I been bloody-minded, I should have
      chosen it and solved the question at once and in my favour by shooting him
      as he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have never been a cruel man, and I could not find it in my heart to
      do this. The silence of the mountain and the sky-which seemed a thing
      apart from the roar of the torrent and not to be broken by it&mdash;awed
      me. The vastness of the solitude in which we sat, the dark void above,
      through which the stars kept shooting, the black gulf below in which the
      unseen waters boiled and surged, the absence of other human company or
      other signs of human existence, put such a face upon the deed that I gave
      up the thought of it with a shudder, and resigned myself, instead, to
      watch through the night&mdash;the long, cold, Pyrenean night. Presently he
      curled himself up like a dog and slept in the blaze, and then for a couple
      of hours I sat opposite him, thinking. It seemed years since I had seen
      Zaton&rsquo;s or thrown the dice. The old life, the old employments&mdash;should
      I ever go back to them?&mdash;seemed dim and distant. Would Cocheforet,
      the forest and the mountain, the grey Chateau and its mistresses, seem one
      day as dim? And if one bit of life could fade so quickly at the unrolling
      of another, and seem in a moment pale and colourless, would all life some
      day and somewhere, and all the things we&mdash;But enough! I was growing
      foolish. I sprang up and kicked the wood together, and, taking up the gun,
      began to pace to and fro under the cliff. Strange that a little moonlight,
      a few stars, a breath of solitude should carry a man back to childhood and
      childish things.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three in the afternoon of the next day, and the sun lay hot on the
      oak groves, and the air was full of warmth as we began to climb the slope,
      midway up which the road to Auch shoots out of the track. The yellow
      bracken and the fallen leaves underfoot seemed to throw up light of
      themselves; and here and there a patch of ruddy beech lay like a
      bloodstain on the hillside. In front a herd of pigs routed among the mast,
      and grunted lazily; and high above us a boy lay watching them. &lsquo;We part
      here,&rsquo; I said to my companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my plan to ride a little way along the road to Auch so as to blind
      his eyes; then, leaving my horse in the forest, I would go on foot to the
      Chateau. &lsquo;The sooner the better!&rsquo; he answered with a snarl. &lsquo;And I hope I
      may never see your face again, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But when we came to the wooden cross at the fork of the roads, and were
      about to part, the boy we had seen leapt out of the fern and came to meet
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hollo!&rsquo; he cried in a sing-song tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; my companion answered, drawing rein impatiently. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are soldiers in the village.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Soldiers,&rsquo; Antoine cried incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, devils on horseback,&rsquo; the lad answered, spitting on the ground.
      &lsquo;Three score of them. From Auch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine turned to me, his face transformed with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curse you!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;This is some of your work. Now we are all undone.
      And my mistresses? SACRE! if I had that gun I would shoot you like a rat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady, fool,&rsquo; I answered roughly. &lsquo;I know no more of this than you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was so true that my surprise was at least as great as his, and
      better grounded. The Cardinal, who rarely made a change of front, had sent
      me hither that he might not be forced to send soldiers, and run the risk
      of all that might arise from such a movement. What of this invasion, then,
      than which nothing could be less consistent with his plans? I wondered. It
      was possible that the travelling merchants, before whom I had played at
      treason, had reported the facts; and that on this the Commandant at Auch
      had acted. But it seemed unlikely since he had had his orders too, and
      under the Cardinal&rsquo;s rule there was small place for individual enterprise.
      Frankly I could not understand it, and found only one thing clear; I might
      now enter the village as I pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going on to look into this,&rsquo; I said to Antoine. &lsquo;Come, my man.&rsquo; He
      shrugged his shoulders, and stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; he answered, with an oath. &lsquo;No soldiers for me I have lain out
      one night, and I can lie out another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded indifferently, for I no longer wanted him; and we parted. After
      this, twenty minutes&rsquo; riding brought me to the entrance of the village,
      and here the change was great indeed. Not one of the ordinary dwellers in
      the place was to be seen: either they had shut themselves up in their
      hovels, or, like Antoine, they had fled to the woods. Their doors were
      closed, their windows shuttered. But lounging about the street were a
      score of dragoons, in boots and breastplates, whose short-barrelled
      muskets, with pouches and bandoliers attached, were piled near the inn
      door. In an open space, where there was a gap in the street, a long row of
      horses, linked head to head, stood bending their muzzles over bundles of
      rough forage; and on all sides the cheerful jingle of chains and bridles
      and the sound of coarse jokes and laughter filled the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rode up to the inn door an old sergeant, with squinting eyes and his
      tongue in his cheek, scanned me inquisitively, and started to cross the
      street to challenge me. Fortunately, at that moment the two knaves whom I
      had brought from Paris with me, and whom I had left at Auch to await my
      orders, came up. I made them a sign not to speak to me, and they passed
      on; but I suppose that they told the sergeant that I was not the man he
      wanted, for I saw no more of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After picketing my horse behind the inn&mdash;I could find no better
      stable, every place being full&mdash;I pushed my way through the group at
      the door, and entered. The old room, with the low, grimy roof and the
      reeking floor, was half full of strange figures, and for a few minutes I
      stood unseen in the smoke and confusion. Then the landlord came my way,
      and as he passed me I caught his eye. He uttered a low curse, dropped the
      pitcher he was carrying, and stood glaring at me like a man possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier whose wine he was carrying flung a crust in his face, with,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, greasy fingers! What are you staring at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil!&rsquo; the landlord muttered, beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let me look at him!&rsquo; the man retorted, and he turned on his stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, finding me standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At your service!&rsquo; I said grimly. &lsquo;A little time and it will be the other
      way, my friend.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. A MASTER STROKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have a way with me which commonly commands respect; and when the
      landlord&rsquo;s first terror was over and he would serve me, I managed to get
      my supper&mdash;the first good meal I had had in two days&mdash;pretty
      comfortably in spite of the soldiers&rsquo; presence. The crowd, too, which
      filled the room, soon began to melt. The men strayed off in groups to
      water their horses, or went to hunt up their quarters, until only two or
      three were left. Dusk had fallen outside; the noise in the street grew
      less. The firelight began to glow and flicker on the walls, and the
      wretched room to look as homely as it was in its nature to look. I was
      pondering for the twentieth time what step I should take next, and
      questioning why the soldiers were here, and whether I should let the night
      pass before I moved, when the door, which had been turning on its hinges
      almost without pause for an hour, opened again, and a woman came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment on the threshold looking round, and I saw that she had
      a shawl on her head and a milk-pitcher in her hand, and that her feet and
      ankles were bare. There was a great rent in her coarse stuff petticoat,
      and the hand which held the shawl together was brown and dirty. More I did
      not see: for, supposing her to be a neighbour stolen in, now that the
      house was quiet, to get some milk for her child or the like, I took no
      farther heed of her. I turned to the fire again and plunged into my
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to get to the hearth where the goodwife was fidgeting the woman had to
      pass in front of me; and as she passed I suppose that she stole a look at
      me from under her shawl. For just when she came between me and the blaze
      she uttered a low cry and shrank aside&mdash;so quickly that she almost
      stepped on the hearth. The next moment she turned her back to me, and was
      stooping whispering in the housewife&rsquo;s ear. A stranger might have thought
      that she had trodden on a hot ember.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another idea, and a very strange one, came into my mind; and I stood
      up silently. The woman&rsquo;s back was towards me, but something in her height,
      her shape, the pose of her head hidden as it was by her shawl, seemed
      familiar. I waited while she hung over the fire whispering, and while the
      goodwife slowly filled her pitcher out of the great black pot. But when
      she turned to go, I took a step forward so as to bar her way. And our eyes
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not see her features; they were lost in the shadow of the hood.
      But I saw a shiver run through her from head to foot. And I knew then that
      I had made no mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is too heavy for you, my girl,&rsquo; I said familiarly, as I might have
      spoken to a village wench. &lsquo;I will carry it for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men, who remained lolling at the table, laughed, and the other
      began to sing a low song. The woman trembled in rage or fear; but she kept
      silence and let me take the jug from her hands; and when I went to the
      door and opened it, she followed mechanically. An instant, and the door
      fell to behind us, shutting off the light and glow, and we two stood
      together in the growing dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is late for you to be out, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said politely. &lsquo;You might
      meet with some rudeness, dressed as you are. Permit me to see you home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, and I thought that I heard her sob, but she did not answer.
      Instead, she turned and walked quickly through the village in the
      direction of the Chateau, keeping in the shadow of the houses. I carried
      the pitcher and walked close to her, beside her; and in the dark I smiled.
      I knew how shame and impotent rage were working in her. This was something
      like revenge!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;where are your grooms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me one look, her eyes blazing with anger, her face like hate
      itself; and after that I said no more, but left her in peace, and
      contented myself with walking at her shoulder until we came to the end of
      the village, where the track to the great house plunged into the wood.
      There she stopped, and turned on me like a wild creature at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; she cried hoarsely, breathing as if she had been
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To see you safe to the house,&rsquo; I answered coolly. &lsquo;Alone you might be
      insulted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if I will not?&rsquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The choice does not lie with you, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered sternly, &lsquo;You
      will go to the house with me, and on the way you will give me an interview&mdash;late
      as it is; but not here. Here we are not private enough. We may be
      interrupted at any moment, and I wish to speak to you at length.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At length?&rsquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw her shiver. &lsquo;What if I will not?&rsquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might call to the nearest soldiers and tell them who you are,&rsquo; I
      answered coolly. &lsquo;I might do that, but I should not. That were a clumsy
      way of punishing you, and I know a better way. I should go to the Captain,
      Mademoiselle, and tell him whose horse is locked up in the inn stable. A
      trooper told me&mdash;as someone had told him&mdash;that it belonged to
      one of his officers; but I looked through the crack, and I knew the horse
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not repress a groan. I waited; still she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go to the Captain?&rsquo; I said ruthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook the hood back from her face and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you coward! you coward!&rsquo; she hissed through her teeth. &lsquo;If I had a
      knife!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have not, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered, unmoved. &lsquo;Be good enough,
      therefore, to make up your mind which it is to be. Am I to go with my news
      to the captain, or am I to come with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the pitcher,&rsquo; she said harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so, wondering. In a moment she flung it with a savage gesture far
      into the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if you will. But some day God will punish you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without another word she turned and entered the path through the trees,
      and I followed her. I suppose that every one of its windings, every hollow
      and broken place in it had been known to her from childhood, for she
      followed it swiftly and unerringly, barefoot as she was. I had to walk
      fast through the darkness to keep up with her. The wood was quiet, but the
      frogs were beginning to croak in the pool, and their persistent chorus
      reminded me of the night when I had come to the house-door, hurt and worn
      out, and Clon had admitted me, and she had stood under the gallery in the
      hall. Things had looked dark then. I had seen but a very little way ahead
      then. Now all was plain. The commandant might be here with all his
      soldiers, but it was I who held the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to the little wooden bridge and saw beyond the dark meadows the
      lights of the house. All the windows were bright. Doubtless the troopers
      were making merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said quietly, &lsquo;I must trouble you to stop here, and
      give me your attention for a few minutes. Afterwards you may go your way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak!&rsquo; she said defiantly. &lsquo;And be quick! I cannot breathe the air where
      you are! It poisons me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I said slowly. &lsquo;Do you think that you make things better by such
      speeches as those?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she cried and I heard her teeth click together. &lsquo;Would you have me
      fawn on you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Still you make one mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You forget that I am to be feared as well as&mdash;loathed, Mademoiselle!
      Ay, Mademoiselle, to be feared!&rsquo; I continued grimly. &lsquo;Do you think that I
      do not know why you are here in this guise? Do you think that I do not
      know for whom that pitcher of broth was intended? Or who will now have to
      fast to-night? I tell you I know all these things. Your house was full of
      soldiers; your servants were watched and could not leave. You had to come
      yourself and get food for him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She clutched at the handrail of the bridge, and for an instant clung to it
      for support. Her face, from which the shawl had fallen, glimmered white in
      the shadow of the trees. At last I had shaken her pride. At last!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your price?&rsquo; she murmured faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to tell you,&rsquo; I replied, speaking so that every word might
      fall distinctly on her ears, and sating my eyes the while on her proud
      face. I had never dreamed of such revenge as this! &lsquo;About a fortnight ago,
      M. de Cocheforet left here at night with a little orange-coloured sachet
      in his possession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a stifled cry, and drew herself stiffly erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It contained&mdash;but there, Mademoiselle, you know its contents,&rsquo; I
      went on. &lsquo;Whatever they were, M. de Cocheforet lost it and them at
      starting. A week ago he came back&mdash;unfortunately for himself&mdash;to
      seek them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking full in my face now. She seemed scarcely to breathe in the
      intensity of her surprise and expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had a search made, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I continued quietly. &lsquo;Your servants
      left no place unexplored The paths, the roads, the very woods were
      ransacked, But in vain, because all the while the orange sachet lay whole
      and unopened in my pocket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; she cried impetuously. &lsquo;There, you lie sir, as usual! The sachet was
      found, torn open, many leagues from this place!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where I threw it, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;that I might mislead your
      rascals and be free to return to you. Oh! believe me,&rsquo; I continued,
      letting something of my true self, something of my triumph, appear at last
      in my voice. &lsquo;You have made a mistake! You would have done better had you
      trusted me. I am no bundle of sawdust, Mademoiselle, though once you got
      the better of me, but a man; a man with an arm to shield and a brain to
      serve, and&mdash;as I am going to teach you&mdash;a heart also!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the orange-coloured sachet that you lost I believe that there were
      eighteen stones of great value?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but she looked at me as if I fascinated her. Her very
      breath seemed to pause and wait on my words. She was so little conscious
      of anything else, of anything outside ourselves, that a score of men might
      have come up behind her, unseen and unnoticed.

      CHAPTER VIII. A MASTER STROKE&mdash;Continued
    </h2>
    <p>
      I took from my breast a little packet wrapped in soft leather, and I held
      it towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you open this?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I believe that it contains what your
      brother lost. That it contains all I will not answer, Mademoiselle,
      because I spilled the stones on the floor of my room, and I may have
      failed to find some. But the others can be recovered; I know where they
      are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the packet slowly and began to unroll it, her fingers shaking. A
      few turns and the mild lustre of the stones shone out, making a kind of
      moonlight in her hands&mdash;such a shimmering glory of imprisoned light
      as has ruined many a woman and robbed many a man of his honour. MORBLEU!
      as I looked at them and as she stood looking at them in dull, entranced
      perplexity&mdash;I wondered how I had come to resist the temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I gazed her hands began to waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot count,&rsquo; she muttered helplessly. &lsquo;How many are there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In all, eighteen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There should be eighteen,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her hand on them with that, and opened it again, and did so
      twice, as if to reassure herself that the stones were real and that she
      was not dreaming. Then she turned to me with sudden fierceness, and I saw
      that her beautiful face, sharpened by the greed of possession, was grown
      as keen and vicious as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she muttered between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your price, man? Your price?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am coming to it now, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said gravely. &lsquo;It is a simple
      matter. You remember the afternoon when I followed you&mdash;clumsily and
      thoughtlessly perhaps&mdash;through the wood to restore these things? In
      seeming that happened about a month ago. I believe that it happened the
      day before yesterday. You called me then some very harsh names, which I
      will not hurt you by repeating. The only price I ask for the restoration
      of your jewels is that you on your part recall those names.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; she muttered. &lsquo;I do not understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated my words very slowly. &lsquo;The only price or reward I ask,
      Mademoiselle, is that you take back those names and say that they were not
      deserved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the jewels?&rsquo; she exclaimed hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are yours. They are not mine. They are nothing to me. Take them, and
      say that you do not think of me&mdash;Nay, I cannot say the words,
      Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is something&mdash;else! What else?&rsquo; she cried, her head thrown
      back, her eyes, bright as any wild animal&rsquo;s, searching mine. &lsquo;Ha! my
      brother? What of him? What of him, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For him, Mademoiselle&mdash;I would prefer that you should tell me no
      more than I know already,&rsquo; I answered in a low voice. &lsquo;I do not wish to be
      in that affair. But yes; there is one thing I have not mentioned. You are
      right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed so deeply that I caught the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; I continued slowly, &lsquo;that you will permit me to remain at
      Cocheforet for a few days while the soldiers are here. I am told that
      there are twenty men and two officers quartered in your house. Your
      brother is away. I ask to be permitted, Mademoiselle, to take his place
      for the time, and to be privileged to protect your sister and yourself
      from insult. That is all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hand to her head. After a long pause,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The frogs!&rsquo; she muttered, &lsquo;they croak! I can not hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to my surprise, she turned quickly and suddenly on her heel, and
      walked over the bridge, leaving me standing there. For a moment I stood
      aghast, peering after her shadowy figure, and wondering what had taken
      her. Then, in a minute or less, she came quickly back to me, and I
      understood. She was crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. de Barthe,&rsquo; she said, in a trembling voice, which told me that the
      victory was won, &lsquo;is there nothing else? Have you no other penance for
      me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had drawn the shawl over her head, and I no longer saw her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all you ask?&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all I ask&mdash;now,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is granted,&rsquo; she said slowly and firmly. &lsquo;Forgive me if I seem to
      speak lightly&mdash;if I seem to make little of your generosity or my
      shame; but I can say no more now. I am so deep in trouble and so gnawed by
      terror that&mdash;I cannot feel anything keenly to-night, either shame or
      gratitude. I am in a dream; God grant that it may pass as a dream! We are
      sunk in trouble. But for you and what you have done, M. de Barthe&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo; 
      she paused and I heard her fighting with the sobs which choked her&mdash;&lsquo;forgive
      me... I am overwrought. And my&mdash;my feet are cold,&rsquo; she added,
      suddenly and irrelevantly. &lsquo;Will you take me home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I cried remorsefully, &lsquo;I have been a beast! You are
      barefoot, and I have kept you here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; she said in a voice which thrilled me. &lsquo;My heart is warm,
      Monsieur&mdash;thanks to you. It is many hours since it has been as warm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped out of the shadow as she spoke&mdash;and there, the thing was
      done. As I had planned, so it had come about. Once more I was crossing the
      meadow in the dark to be received at Cocheforet, a welcome guest. The
      frogs croaked in the pool and a bat swooped round us in circles; and
      surely never&mdash;never, I thought, with a kind of exultation in my
      breast&mdash;had man been placed in a stranger position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the black wood behind us&mdash;probably in the outskirts of
      the village&mdash;lurked M. de Cocheforet. In the great house before us,
      outlined by a score of lighted windows, were the soldiers come from Auch
      to take him. Between the two, moving side by side in the darkness, in a
      silence which each found to be eloquent, were Mademoiselle and I: she who
      knew so much, I who knew all&mdash;all but one little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached the house, and I suggested that she should steal in first by
      the way she had come out, and that I should wait a little and knock at the
      door when she had had time to explain matters to Clon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They do not let me see Clon,&rsquo; she answered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then your woman must tell him,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;or he may do something and
      betray me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will not let our women come to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; I cried, astonished. &lsquo;But this is infamous. You are not
      prisoners!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle laughed harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we not? Well, I suppose not; for if we wanted company, Captain
      Larolle said that he would be delighted to see us&mdash;in the parlour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has taken your parlour?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He and his lieutenant sit there. But I suppose that we rebels should be
      thankful,&rsquo; she added bitterly; &lsquo;we have still our bedrooms left to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Then I must deal with Clon as I can. But I have
      still a favour to ask, Mademoiselle. It is only that you and your sister
      will descend to-morrow at your usual time. I shall be in the parlour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather not,&rsquo; she said, pausing and speaking in a troubled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you afraid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Monsieur, I am not afraid,&rsquo; she answered proudly, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will come?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed before she spoke. At length,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will come&mdash;if you wish it,&rsquo; she answered. And the next moment
      she was gone round the corner of the house, while I laughed to think of
      the excellent watch these gallant gentlemen were keeping. M. de Cocheforet
      might have been with her in the garden, might have talked with her as I
      had talked, might have entered the house even, and passed under their
      noses scot-free. But that is the way of soldiers. They are always ready
      for the enemy, with drums beating and flags flying&mdash;at ten o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning. But he does not always come at that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited a little, and then I groped my way to the door and knocked on it
      with the hilt of my sword. The dogs began to bark at the back, and the
      chorus of a drinking-song, which came fitfully from the east wing, ceased
      altogether. An inner door opened, and an angry voice, apparently an
      officer&rsquo;s, began to rate someone for not coming. Another moment, and a
      clamour of voices and footsteps seemed to pour into the hall, and fill it.
      I heard the bar jerked away, the door was flung open, and in a twinkling a
      lanthorn, behind which a dozen flushed visages were dimly seen, was thrust
      into my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, who the fiend is this?&rsquo; one cried, glaring at me in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MORBLEU! It is the man!&rsquo; another shrieked. &lsquo;Seize him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment half a dozen hands were laid on my shoulders, but I only bowed
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The officer, my friends,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;M. le Capitaine Larolle. &lsquo;Where is
      he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DIABLE! but who are you, first?&rsquo; the lanthorn-bearer retorted bluntly. He
      was a tall, lanky sergeant, with a sinister face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I am not M. de Cocheforet,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;and that must satisfy you,
      my man. For the rest, if you do not fetch Captain Larolle at once and
      admit me, you will find the consequences inconvenient.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho! ho!&rsquo; he said with a sneer. &lsquo;You can crow, it seems. Well, come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They made way, and I walked into the hall keeping my hat on. On the great
      hearth a fire had been kindled, but it had gone out. Three or four
      carbines stood against one wall, and beside them lay a heap of haversacks
      and some straw. A shattered stool, broken in a frolic, and half a dozen
      empty wine-skins strewed the floor, and helped to give the place an air of
      untidiness and disorder. I looked round with eyes of disgust, and my gorge
      rose. They had spilled oil, and the place reeked foully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;VENTRE BLEU!&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Is this conduct in a gentleman&rsquo;s house, you
      rascals? MA VIE! If I had you I would send half of you to the wooden
      horse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They gazed at me open-mouthed; my arrogance startled them. The sergeant
      alone scowled. When he could find his voice for rage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We did not know that a general officer was coming,
      or we would have been better prepared!&rsquo; And muttering oaths under his
      breath, he led me down the well-known passage. At the door of the parlour
      he stopped. &lsquo;Introduce yourself!&rsquo; he said rudely. &lsquo;And if you find the air
      warm, don&rsquo;t blame me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised the latch and went in. At a table in front of the hearth, half
      covered with glasses and bottles, sat two men playing hazard. The dice
      rang sharply as I entered, and he who had just thrown kept the box over
      them while he turned, scowling, to see who came in. He was a fair-haired,
      blonde man, large-framed and florid. He had put off his cuirass and boots,
      and his doublet showed frayed and stained where the armour had pressed on
      it. Otherwise he was in the extreme of last year&rsquo;s fashion. His deep
      cravat, folded over so that the laced ends drooped a little in front, was
      of the finest; his great sash of blue and silver was a foot wide. He had a
      little jewel in one ear, and his tiny beard was peaked A L&rsquo;ESPAGNOLE.
      Probably when he turned he expected to see the sergeant, for at the sight
      of me he rose slowly, leaving the dice still covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What folly is this?&rsquo; he cried, wrathfully. Here, sergeant! Sergeant!&mdash;without
      there! What the&mdash;! Who are you, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Larolle,&rsquo; I said uncovering politely, &lsquo;I believe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am Captain Larolle,&rsquo; he retorted. &lsquo;But who, in the fiend&rsquo;s name,
      are you?&rsquo; You are not the man we are after!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not M. Cocheforet,&rsquo; I said coolly. &lsquo;I am merely a guest in the
      house, M. le Capitaine. I have been enjoying Madame de Cocheforet&rsquo;s
      hospitality for some time, but by an evil chance I was away when you
      arrived.&rsquo; And with that I walked to the hearth, and, gently pushing aside
      his great boots which stood there drying, I kicked the logs into a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MILLE DIABLES!&rsquo; he whispered. And never did I see a man more confounded.
      But I affected to be taken up with his companion, a sturdy,
      white-moustachioed old veteran, who sat back in his chair, eyeing me with
      swollen cheeks and eyes surcharged with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good evening, M. le Lieutenant,&rsquo; I said, bowing gravely. &lsquo;It is a fine
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the storm burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine night!&rsquo; the Captain shrieked, finding his voice at last. &lsquo;MILLE
      DIABLES! Are you aware, sir, that I am in possession of this house, and
      that no one harbours here without my permission? Guest? Hospitality?
      Bundle of fiddle-faddle! Lieutenant, call the guard! Call the guard!&rsquo; he
      continued passionately. &lsquo;Where is that ape of a sergeant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant rose to obey, but I lifted my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gently, gently, Captain,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Not so fast. You seem surprised to see
      me here. Believe me, I am much more surprised to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SACRE!&rsquo; he cried, recoiling at this fresh impertinence, while the
      Lieutenant&rsquo;s eyes almost jumped out of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing moved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the door closed?&rsquo; I said sweetly. &lsquo;Thank you; it is, I see. Then
      permit me to say again, gentlemen, that I am much more surprised to see
      you than you can be to see me. For when Monseigneur the Cardinal honoured
      me by sending me from Paris to conduct this matter, he gave me the fullest&mdash;the
      fullest powers, M. le Capitaine&mdash;to see the affair to an end. I was
      not led to expect that my plans would be spoiled on the eve of success by
      the intrusion of half the garrison from Auch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ho!&rsquo; the Captain said softly&mdash;in a very different tone, and with
      a very different face. &lsquo;So you are the gentleman I heard of at Auch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; I said drily. &lsquo;But I am from Paris, not from Auch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; he answered thoughtfully. &lsquo;Eh, Lieutenant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, M. le Capitaine, no doubt,&rsquo; the inferior replied. And they both
      looked at one another, and then at me, in a way I did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said I, to clinch the matter, &lsquo;that you have made a mistake,
      Captain; or the Commandant has. And it occurs to me that the Cardinal will
      not be best pleased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hold the King&rsquo;s commission,&rsquo; he answered rather stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;But, you see, the Cardinal&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, but the Cardinal&mdash;&rsquo; he rejoined quickly; and then he stopped and
      shrugged his shoulders. And they both looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King,&rsquo; he answered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut-tut!&rsquo; I exclaimed, spreading out my hands. &lsquo;The Cardinal. Let us
      stick to him. You were saying?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, the Cardinal, you see&mdash;&rsquo; And then again, after the same words,
      he stopped&mdash;stopped abruptly, and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to suspect something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have anything to say against Monseigneur,&rsquo; I answered, watching
      him narrowly, &lsquo;say it. But take a word of advice. Don&rsquo;t let it go beyond
      the door of this room, my friend, and it will do you no harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither here nor outside,&rsquo; he retorted, looking for a moment at his
      comrade. &lsquo;Only I hold the King&rsquo;s commission. That is all, and, I think,
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;for the rest, will you throw a main?&rsquo; he answered evasively.
      &lsquo;Good! Lieutenant, find a glass, and the gentleman a seat. And here, for
      my part, I will give you a toast The Cardinal&mdash;whatever betide!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I drank it, and sat down to play with him; I had not heard the music of
      the dice for a month, and the temptation was irresistible. But I was not
      satisfied. I called the mains and won his crowns&mdash;he was a mere baby
      at the game&mdash;but half my mind was elsewhere. There was something here
      that I did not understand; some influence at work on which I had not
      counted; something moving under the surface as unintelligible to me as the
      soldiers&rsquo; presence. Had the Captain repudiated my commission altogether,
      and put me to the door or sent me to the guard-house, I could have
      followed that. But these dubious hints, this passive resistance, puzzled
      me. Had they news from Paris, I wondered? Was the King dead? Or the
      Cardinal ill? I asked them, but they said no, no, no to all, and gave me
      guarded answers. And midnight found us still playing; and still fencing.

      CHAPTER IX. THE QUESTION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Sweep the room, Monsieur? And remove this medley? But M. le Capitaine&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Captain is in the village,&rsquo; I replied Sternly. &lsquo;And do you move.
      Move, man, and the thing will be done while you are talking about it. Set
      the door into the garden open&mdash;so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, it is a fine morning. And the tobacco of M. le Lieutenant&mdash;But
      M. le Capitaine did not&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give orders? Well, I give them,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;First of all, remove these
      beds. And bustle, man, bustle, or I will find something to quicken you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment&mdash;&lsquo;And M. le Capitaine&rsquo;s riding-boots?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Place them in the passage,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! in the passage?&rsquo; He paused, looking at them in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, booby; in the passage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the cloaks, Monsieur?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a bush handy outside the window. Let them air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ohe, the bush? Well, to be sure they are damp. But&mdash;yes, yes,
      Monsieur, it is done. And the bolsters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There also,&rsquo; I said harshly. &lsquo;Throw them out. Faugh! The place reeks of
      leather. Now, a clean hearth. And set the table before the open door, so
      that we may see the garden&mdash;so. And tell the cook that we dine at
      eleven, and that Madame and Mademoiselle will descend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ohe! But M. le Capitaine ordered the dinner for half-past eleven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be advanced, then; and, mark you, my friend, if it is not ready
      when Madame comes down, you will suffer, and the cook too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone on his errand, I looked round. What else was lacking? The
      sun shone cheerily on the polished floor; the air, freshened by the rain
      which had fallen in the night, entered freely through the open doorway. A
      few bees lingering with the summer hummed outside. The fire crackled
      bravely; an old hound, blind and past work, lay warming its hide on the
      hearth. I could think of nothing more, and I stood and stood and watched
      the man set out the table and spread the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For how many, Monsieur?&rsquo; he asked in a scared tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For five,&rsquo; I answered; and I could not help smiling at myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what would Zaton&rsquo;s say could it see Berault turned housewife? There
      was a white glazed cup, an old-fashioned piece of the second Henry&rsquo;s time,
      standing on a shelf. I took it down and put some late flowers in it, and
      set it in the middle of the table, and stood off myself to look at it. But
      a moment later, thinking I heard them coming, I hurried it away in a kind
      of panic, feeling on a sudden ashamed of the thing. The alarm proved to be
      false, however; and then again, taking another turn, I set the piece back.
      I had done nothing so foolish for&mdash;for more years than I like to
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Madame and Mademoiselle came down, they had eyes neither for the
      flowers nor the room. They had heard that the Captain was out beating the
      village and the woods for the fugitive, and where I had looked for a
      comedy I found a tragedy. Madame&rsquo;s face was so red with weeping that all
      her beauty was gone. She started and shook at the slightest sound, and,
      unable to find any words to answer my greeting, could only sink into a
      chair and sit crying silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was in a mood scarcely more cheerful. She did not weep, but
      her manner was hard and fierce. She spoke absently, and answered
      fretfully. Her eyes glittered, and she had the air of straining her ears
      continually to catch some dreaded sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no news, Monsieur?&rsquo; she said as she took her seat. And she shot
      a swift look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are searching the village?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Clon?&rsquo; This in a lower voice, and with a kind of shrinking in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. &lsquo;I believe that they have him confined somewhere. And
      Louis, too,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;But I have not seen either of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where are&mdash;I thought these people would be here,&rsquo; she muttered.
      And she glanced askance at the two vacant places. The servant had brought
      in the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will be here presently,&rsquo; I said coolly. Let us make the most of the
      time. A little wine and food will do Madame good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled rather sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that we have changed places,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;And that you have turned
      host and we guests.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it be so,&rsquo; I said cheerfully. &lsquo;I recommend some of this ragout. Come,
      Mademoiselle, fasting can aid no one. A full meal has saved many a man&rsquo;s
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clumsily said, perhaps; for she shuddered and looked at me with a
      ghastly smile. But she persuaded her sister to take something; and she
      took something on her own plate and raised her fork to her lips. But in a
      moment she laid it down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;I cannot swallow. Oh, my God, at this moment
      they may be taking him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that she was about to burst into a passion of tears, and I
      repented that I had induced her to descend. But her self-control was not
      yet exhausted. By an effort, painful to see, she recovered her composure.
      She took up her fork, and ate a few mouthfuls. Then she looked at me with
      a fierce under-look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to see Clon,&rsquo; she whispered feverishly. The man who waited on us
      had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He knows?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, her beautiful face strangely disfigured. Her closed teeth
      showed between her lips. Two red spots burned in her white cheeks, and she
      breathed quickly. I felt, as I looked at her, a sudden pain at my heart,
      and a shuddering fear, such as a man, awaking to find himself falling over
      a precipice, might feel. How these women loved the man!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I could not speak. When I found my voice it sounded dry and
      husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a safe confidant,&rsquo; I muttered. &lsquo;He can neither read nor write,
      Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but&mdash;&rsquo; and then her face became fixed. &lsquo;They are coming,&rsquo; she
      whispered. &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; She rose stiffly, and stood supporting herself by the
      table. &lsquo;Have they&mdash;have they&mdash;found him?&rsquo; she muttered. The
      woman by her side wept on, unconscious of what was impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the Captain stumble far down the passage, and swear loudly; and I
      touched Mademoiselle&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have not!&rsquo; I whispered. &lsquo;All is well, Mademoiselle. Pray, pray calm
      yourself. Sit down and meet them as if nothing were the matter. And your
      sister! Madame, Madame,&rsquo; I cried, almost harshly, &lsquo;compose yourself.
      Remember that you have a part to play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My appeal did something. Madame stifled her sobs. Mademoiselle drew a deep
      breath and sat down; and though she was still pale and still trembled, the
      worst was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And only just in time. The door flew open with a crash. The Captain
      stumbled into the room, swearing afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SACRE NOM DU DIABLE!&rsquo; he cried, his face crimson with rage. &lsquo;What fool
      placed these things here? My boots? My&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His jaw fell. He stopped on the word, stricken silent by the new aspect of
      the room, by the sight of the little party at the table, by all the
      changes I had worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SAINT SIEGE!&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; The Lieutenant&rsquo;s grizzled face
      peering over his shoulder completed the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are rather late, M. le Capitaine,&rsquo; I said cheerfully. &lsquo;Madame&rsquo;s hour
      is eleven. But, come here are your seats waiting for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MILLE TONNERRES!&rsquo; he muttered, advancing into the room, and glaring at
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid that the ragout is cold,&rsquo; I continued, peering into the dish
      and affecting to see nothing. &lsquo;The soup, however, has been kept hot by the
      fire. But I think that you do not see Madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his mouth to swear, but for the moment he thought better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&mdash;who put my boots in the passage?&rsquo; he asked, his voice thick
      with rage. He did not bow to the ladies, or take any notice of their
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the men, I suppose,&rsquo; I said indifferently. &lsquo;Is anything missing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glared at me. Then his cloak, spread outside, caught his eye. He strode
      through the door, saw his holsters lying on the grass, and other things
      strewn about. He came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose monkey game is this?&rsquo; he snarled, and his face was very ugly. &lsquo;Who
      is at the bottom of this? Speak, sir, or I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tut-tut,&mdash;the ladies!&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You forget yourself, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forget myself?&rsquo; he hissed, and this time he did not check his oath.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of the ladies! Madame? Bah! Do you think, fool, that we
      are put into rebel&rsquo;s houses to bow and smile and take dancing lessons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this case a lesson in politeness were more to the point, Monsieur,&rsquo; I
      said sternly. And I rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it by your orders that this was done?&rsquo; he retorted, his brow black
      with passion. Answer, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was!&rsquo; I replied outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then take that!&rsquo; he cried, dashing his hat violently in my face, &lsquo;and
      come outside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure, Monsieur,&rsquo; I answered, bowing; &lsquo;in one moment. Permit me
      to find my sword. I think that it is in the passage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I went thither to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned, I found that the two men were waiting for me in the
      garden, while the ladies had risen from the table, and were standing near
      it with blanched faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better take your sister upstairs, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said gently,
      pausing a moment beside them. &lsquo;Have no fear. All will be well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is it?&rsquo; she answered, looking troubled. &lsquo;It was so sudden. I am&mdash;I
      did not understand. You quarrelled so quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very simple,&rsquo; I answered, smiling. &lsquo;M. le Capitaine insulted you
      yesterday; he will pay for it to-day. That is all. Or, not quite all,&rsquo; I
      continued, dropping my voice and speaking in a different tone. &lsquo;His
      removal may help you, Mademoiselle. Do you understand? I think that there
      will be no more searching to-day.&rsquo; She uttered an exclamation, grasping my
      arm and peering into my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will kill him?&rsquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath, and stood with one hand clasped to her bosom,
      gazing at me with parted lips, the blood mounting to her checks. Gradually
      the flush melted into a fierce smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, why not?&rsquo; she repeated between her teeth. &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; She had
      her hand on my arm, and I felt her fingers tighten until I could have
      winced. &lsquo;Why not? So you planned this&mdash;for us, Monsieur?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But can you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Safely,&rsquo; I said; then, muttering to her to take her sister upstairs, I
      turned towards the garden. My foot was already on the threshold, and I was
      composing my face to meet the enemy, when I heard a movement behind me.
      The next moment her hand was on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait! Wait a moment! Come back!&rsquo; she panted. I turned. The smile and
      flush had vanished; her face was pale. &lsquo;No!&rsquo; she said abruptly. &lsquo;I was
      wrong! I, will not have it. I will have no part in it! You planned it last
      night, M. de Barthe. It is murder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle!&rsquo; I exclaimed, wondering. &lsquo;Murder? Why? It is a duel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is murder,&rsquo; she answered persistently. &lsquo;You planned it last night. You
      said so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I risk my own life,&rsquo; I replied sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevertheless&mdash;I will have no part in it,&rsquo; she answered more faintly.
      She was trembling with agitation. Her eyes avoided mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my shoulders be it then!&rsquo; I replied stoutly. &lsquo;It is too late,
      Mademoiselle, to go back. They are waiting for me. Only, before I go, let
      me beg of you to retire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And I turned from her, and went out, wondering and thinking. First, that
      women were strange things. Secondly&mdash;MURDER? Merely because I had
      planned the duel and provoked the quarrel! Never had I heard anything so
      preposterous. Grant it, and dub every man who kept his honour with his
      hands a Cain&mdash;and a good many branded faces would be seen in some
      streets. I laughed at the fancy, as I strode down the garden walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, perhaps, I was going to do a foolish thing. The Lieutenant would
      still be here: a hard-bitten man, of stiffer stuff than his Captain. And
      the troopers. What if, when I had killed their leader, they made the place
      too hot for me, Monseigneur&rsquo;s commission notwithstanding? I should look
      silly, indeed, if on the eve of success I were driven from the place by a
      parcel of jack-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked the thought so little that I hesitated. Yet it seemed too late to
      retreat. The Captain and the Lieutenant were waiting for me in a little
      open space fifty yards from the house, where a narrower path crossed the
      broad walk, down which I had first seen Mademoiselle and her sister
      pacing. The Captain had removed his doublet, and stood in his shirt
      leaning against the sundial, his head bare and his sinewy throat
      uncovered. He had drawn his rapier and stood pricking the ground
      impatiently. I marked his strong and nervous frame and his sanguine air:
      and twenty years earlier the sight might have damped me. But no thought of
      the kind entered my head now, and though I felt with each moment greater
      reluctance to engage, doubt of the issue had no place in my calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made ready slowly, and would gladly, to gain time, have found some fault
      with the place. But the sun was sufficiently high to give no advantage to
      either. The ground was good, the spot well chosen. I could find no excuse
      to put off the man, and I was about to salute him and fall to work when a
      thought crossed my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One moment!&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Supposing I kill you, M. le Capitaine, what becomes
      of your errand here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself;&rsquo; he answered with a sneer he had misread my
      slowness and hesitation. &lsquo;It will not happen, Monsieur. And in any case
      the thought need not harass you. I have a Lieutenant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but what of my mission?&rsquo; I replied bluntly. &lsquo;I have no lieutenant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have thought of that before you interfered with my boots,&rsquo; he
      retorted with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; I said overlooking his manner. &lsquo;But better late than never. I am
      not sure, now I think of it, that my duty to Monseigneur will let me
      fight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will swallow the blow?&rsquo; he cried, spitting on the ground offensively.
      &lsquo;DIABLE!&rsquo; And the Lieutenant, standing on one side with his hands behind
      him and his shoulders squared, laughed grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not made up my mind,&rsquo; I answered irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, NOM DE DIEU! make it up,&rsquo; the Captain replied, with an ugly sneer.
      He took a swaggering step this way and that, playing his weapon. &lsquo;I am
      afraid, Lieutenant, that there will be no sport to-day,&rsquo; he continued in a
      loud aside. &lsquo;Our cock has but a chicken heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said coolly, &lsquo;I do not know what to do. Certainly it is a fine
      day, and a fair piece of ground. And the sun stands well. But I have not
      much to gain by killing you, M. le Capitaine, and it might get me into an
      awkward fix. On the other hand, it would not hurt me to let you go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; he said contemptuously, looking at me as I should look at a
      lackey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;For if you were to say that you had struck Gil de
      Berault and left the ground with a whole skin, no one would believe you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gil de Berault!&rsquo; he exclaimed frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Monsieur,&rsquo; I replied suavely. &lsquo;At your service. You did not know my
      name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought that your name was De Barthe,&rsquo; he said. His voice sounded
      queerly; and he waited for the answer with parted lips, and a shadow in
      his eyes which I had seen in men&rsquo;s eyes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;that was my mother&rsquo;s name. I took it for this occasion
      only.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His florid cheek lost a shade of its colour, and he bit his lips as he
      glanced at the Lieutenant, trouble in his eyes. I had seen these signs
      before, and knew them, and I might have cried &lsquo;Chicken-heart!&rsquo; in my turn;
      but I had not made a way of escape for him&mdash;before I declared myself&mdash;for
      nothing, and I held to my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you will allow now,&rsquo; I said grimly, &lsquo;that it will not harm me
      even if I put up with a blow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. de Berault&rsquo;s courage is known,&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And with reason,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;That being so suppose that we say this day
      three months, M. le Capitaine? The postponement to be for my convenience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught the Lieutenant&rsquo;s eye and looked down sullenly, the conflict in
      his mind as plain as daylight. He had only to insist that I must fight;
      and if by luck or skill he could master me his fame as a duellist would
      run, like a ripple over water, through every garrison town in France and
      make him a name even in Paris. On the other side were the imminent peril
      of death, the gleam of cold steel already in fancy at his breast, the loss
      of life and sunshine, and the possibility of a retreat with honour, if
      without glory. I read his face, and knew before he spoke what he would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It appears to me that the burden is with you,&rsquo; he said huskily; &lsquo;but for
      my part I am satisfied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I take the burden. Permit me to apologise for having
      caused you to strip unnecessarily. Fortunately the sun is shining.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said gloomily. And he took his clothes from the sundial and
      began to put them on. He had expressed himself satisfied, but I knew that
      he was feeling very ill-satisfied, indeed, with himself; and I was not
      surprised when he presently said abruptly and almost rudely, &lsquo;There is one
      thing that I think we must settle here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our positions,&rsquo; he blurted out, &lsquo;Or we shall cross one another again
      within the hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph! I am not quite sure that I understand,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is precisely what I don&rsquo;t do&mdash;understand!&rsquo; he retorted, in a
      tone of surly triumph. &lsquo;Before I came on this duty, I was told that there
      was a gentleman here, bearing sealed orders from the Cardinal to arrest M.
      de Cocheforet; and I was instructed to avoid collision with him so far as
      might be possible. At first I took you for the gentleman. But the plague
      take me if I understand the matter now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; I said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because&mdash;well, the question is in a nutshell!&rsquo; he answered
      impetuously. &lsquo;Are you here on behalf of Madame de Cocheforet, to shield
      her husband? Or are you here to arrest him? That is what I do not
      understand, M. de Berault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you mean, am I the Cardinal&rsquo;s agent&mdash;I am!&rsquo; I answered sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To arrest M. de Cocheforet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To arrest M. de Cocheforet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;you surprise me,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only that; but he spoke so drily that I felt the blood rush to my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, Monsieur,&rsquo; I said severely. &lsquo;Do not presume too far on the
      inconvenience to which your death might put me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No offence,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But you do not seem, M. de Berault, to comprehend
      the difficulty. If we do not settle things now, we shall be bickering
      twenty times a day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what do you want?&rsquo; I asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Simply to know how you are going to proceed. So that our plans may not
      clash.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely, M. le Capitaine, that is my affair,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The clashing?&rsquo; he answered bitterly. Then he waved aside my wrath
      &lsquo;Pardon,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the point is simply this. How do you propose to find
      him if he is here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That again is my affair,&rsquo; I answered. He threw up his hands in despair;
      but in a moment his place was taken by an unexpected disputant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant, who had stood by all the time, listening and tugging at
      his grey moustache, suddenly spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look here, M. de Berault,&rsquo; he said, confronting me roughly, &lsquo;I do not
      fight duels. I am from the ranks. I proved my courage at Montauban in &lsquo;21,
      and my honour is good enough to take care of itself. So I say what I like,
      and I ask you plainly what M. le Capitaine doubtless has in his mind, but
      does not ask: Are you running with the hare, and hunting with the hounds
      in this matter? In other words, have you thrown up Monseigneur&rsquo;s
      commission in all but name, and become Madame&rsquo;s ally; or&mdash;it is the
      only other alternative&mdash;are you getting at the man through the
      women?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You villain!&rsquo; I cried, glaring at him in such a rage and fury that I
      could scarcely get the words out. This was plain speaking with a
      vengeance! How dare you? How dare you say that I am false to the hand that
      pays me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that he would blench, but he did not. He stood up stiff as a
      poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not say; I ask!&rsquo; he replied, facing me squarely, and slapping his
      fist into his open hand to drive home his words the better. &lsquo;I ask you
      whether you are playing the traitor to the Cardinal, or to these two
      women? It is a simple question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I fairly choked. &lsquo;You impudent scoundrel!&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady, steady!&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Pitch sticks where it belongs, and nowhere
      else. But that is enough. I see which it is, M. le Capitaine; this way a
      moment, by your leave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And in a very cavalier fashion he took his officer by the arm, and drew
      him into a sidewalk, leaving me to stand in the sun, bursting with anger
      and spleen. The gutter-bred rascal! That such a man should insult me, and
      with impunity! In Paris, I might have made him fight, but here it was
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still foaming with rage when they returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have come to a determination,&rsquo; the Lieutenant said, tugging his grey
      moustachios, and standing like a ramrod. &lsquo;We shall leave you the house and
      Madame, and you can take your own line to find the man, for ourselves, we
      shall draw off our men to the village, and we shall take our line. That is
      all, M. le Capitaine, is it not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; the Captain muttered, looking anywhere but at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then we bid you good-day, Monsieur,&rsquo; the Lieutenant added, and in a
      moment he turned his companion round, and the two retired up the walk to
      the house, leaving me to look after them in a black fit of rage and
      incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first flush, there was something so offensive in the manner of
      their going that anger had the upper hand. I thought of the Lieutenant&rsquo;s
      words, and I cursed him to hell with a sickening consciousness that I
      should not forget them in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was I playing the traitor to the Cardinal or to these women&mdash;which?&rsquo; 
      MON DIEU! if ever question&mdash;but there, some day I would punish him.
      And the Captain? I could put an end to his amusement, at any rate; and I
      would. Doubtless among the country bucks of Auch he lorded it as a chief
      provincial bully, but I would cut his comb for him some fine morning
      behind the barracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then as I grew cooler I began to wonder why they were going, and what
      they were going to do. They might be already on the track, or have the
      information they required under hand; in that case I could understand the
      movement. But if they were still searching vaguely, uncertain whether
      their quarry were in the neighbourhood or not, and uncertain how long they
      might have to stay, it seemed incredible that soldiers should move from
      good quarters to bad without motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wandered down the garden, thinking sullenly of this, and pettishly
      cutting off the heads of the flowers with my sheathed sword. After all, if
      they found and arrested the man, what then? I should have to make my peace
      with the Cardinal as I best might. He would have gained his point, but not
      through me, and I should have to look to myself. On the other hand, if I
      anticipated them&mdash;and, as a fact, I believed that I could lay my hand
      on the fugitive within a few hours&mdash;there would come a time when I
      must face Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while back that had not seemed so difficult a thing. From the day
      of our first meeting&mdash;and in a higher degree since that afternoon
      when she had lashed me with her scorn-my views of her, and my feelings
      towards her, had been strangely made up of antagonism and sympathy; of
      repulsion, because in her past and present she was so different from me;
      of yearning because she was a woman and friendless. Later I had duped her
      and bought her confidence by returning the jewels, and so in a measure I
      had sated my vengeance; then, as a consequence, sympathy had again got the
      better of me, until now I hardly knew my own mind, or what I felt, or what
      I intended. I DID NOT KNOW, in fact, what I intended. I stood there in the
      garden with that conviction suddenly newborn in my mind; and then, in a
      moment, I heard her step, and I turned to find her behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was like April, smiles breaking through her tears. As she stood
      with a tall hedge of sunflowers behind her, I started to see how beautiful
      she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here in search of you, M. de Barthe,&rsquo; she said, colouring slightly,
      perhaps because my eyes betrayed my thought; &lsquo;to thank you. You have not
      fought, and yet you have conquered. My woman has just been with me, and
      she tells me that they are going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle, they are leaving the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not understand my reservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What magic have you used?&rsquo; she said almost gaily; it was wonderful how
      hope had changed her. &lsquo;Besides, I am curious to learn how you managed to
      avoid fighting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After taking a blow?&rsquo; I said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur, I did not mean that,&rsquo; she said reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her face clouded. I saw that, viewed in this light&mdash;in which, I
      suppose, she had not hitherto&mdash;the matter perplexed her more than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a sudden resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you ever heard, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said gravely, plucking off while I
      spoke the dead leaves from a plant beside me, &lsquo;of a gentleman by name De
      Berault? Known in Paris, I have heard, by the sobriquet of the Black
      Death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The duellist?&rsquo; she answered, looking at me in wonder. &lsquo;Yes, I have heard
      of him. He killed a young gentleman of this province at Nancy two years
      back. &lsquo;It was a sad story,&rsquo; she continued, shuddering slightly, &lsquo;of a
      dreadful man. God keep our friends from such!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen!&rsquo; I said quietly. But, in spite of myself, I could not meet her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she answered, quickly taking alarm at; my silence. &lsquo;What of him, M.
      de Barthe? Why have you mentioned him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because he is here, Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here?&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;At Cocheforet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered soberly. &lsquo;I am he.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. CLON
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; she cried, in a voice which pierced my heart. &lsquo;You are M. de
      Berault? It is impossible!&rsquo; But, glancing askance at her&mdash;I could not
      face her I saw that the blood had left her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered in a low tone. &lsquo;De Barthe was my mother&rsquo;s
      name. When I came here, a stranger, I took it that I might not be known;
      that I might again speak to a good woman, and not see her shrink. That,
      and&mdash;but why trouble you with all this?&rsquo; I continued rebelling,
      against her silence, her turned shoulder, her averted face. &lsquo;You asked me,
      Mademoiselle, how I could take a blow and let the striker go. I have
      answered. It is the one privilege M. de Berault possesses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; she replied almost in a whisper, &lsquo;if I were M. de Berault, I would
      avail myself of it, and never fight again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that event, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered coldly, &lsquo;I should lose my men
      friends as well as my women friends. Like Monseigneur the Cardinal, rule
      by fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, either at the name or at the idea my words called up; and,
      for a moment, we stood awkwardly silent. The shadow of the sundial fell
      between us; the garden was still; here and there a leaf fluttered slowly
      down. With each instant of that silence, of that aversion, I felt the gulf
      between us growing wider, I felt myself growing harder; I mocked at her
      past which was so unlike mine; I mocked at mine, and called it fate. I was
      on the point of turning from her with a bow&mdash;and with a furnace in my
      breast&mdash;when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a last rose lingering there,&rsquo; she said, a slight tremor in her
      voice. &lsquo;I cannot reach it. Will you pluck it for me, M. de Berault?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed her, my hand trembling, my face on fire. She took the rose from
      me, and placed it in the bosom of her dress, And I saw that her hand
      trembled too, and that her cheek was dark with blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned without more ado, and began to walk towards the house. &lsquo;Heaven
      forbid that I should misjudge you a second time!&rsquo; she said in a low voice.
      &lsquo;And, after all, who am I, that I should judge you at all? An hour ago I
      would have killed that man had I possessed the power.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You repented, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said huskily. I could scarcely speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you never repent?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. But too late, Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it is never too late,&rsquo; she answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas, when a man is dead&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may rob a man of worse than life!&rsquo; she replied with energy, stopping
      me by a gesture. &lsquo;If you have never robbed a man&mdash;or a woman&mdash;of
      honour! If you have never ruined boy or girl, M. de Berault! If you have
      never pushed another into the pit and gone by it yourself! If&mdash;but,
      for murder? Listen. You are a Romanist, but I am a Huguenot, and have
      read. &ldquo;Thou shall not kill!&rdquo; it is written; and the penalty, &ldquo;By man shall
      thy blood be shed!&rdquo; But, &ldquo;If you cause one of these little ones to offend,
      it were better for you that a mill-stone were hanged about your neck, and
      that you were cast into the depths of the sea.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle, you are merciful,&rsquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I need mercy myself,&rsquo; she answered, sighing. &lsquo;And I have had few
      temptations. How do I know what you have suffered?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or done!&rsquo; I said, almost rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where a man has not lied, nor betrayed, nor sold himself or others,&rsquo; she
      answered in a low tone, &lsquo;I think I can forgive all else. I can better put
      up with force,&rsquo; she added smiling sadly, &lsquo;than with fraud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Dieu! I turned away my face that she might not see how pale it grew;
      that she might not guess how her words, meant in mercy, stabbed me to the
      heart. And yet, then, for the first time, while viewing in all its depth
      and width the gulf which separated us, I was not hardened; I was not cast
      back upon myself. Her gentleness, her pity, her humility softened me,
      while they convicted me. My God, how, after this, could I do that which I
      had come to do? How could I stab her in the tenderest part, how could I
      inflict on her that rending pang, how could I meet her eyes, and stand
      before her, a Caliban, a Judas, the vilest, lowest thing she could
      conceive?
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood, a moment, speechless and disordered; overcome by her words, by my
      thoughts. I have seen a man so stand when he has lost all at the tables.
      Then I turned to her; and for an instant I thought that my tale was told
      already, I thought that she had pierced my disguise. For her face was
      changed&mdash;stricken as with fear. The next moment, I saw that she was
      not looking at me, but beyond me; and I turned quickly and saw a servant
      hurrying from the house to us. It was Louis. His eyes were staring, his
      hair waved, his cheeks were flabby with dismay, He breathed as if he had
      been running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; Mademoiselle cried, while he was still some way off. &lsquo;Speak,
      man. My sister? Is she&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clon,&rsquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name changed her to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clon? What of him?&rsquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the village!&rsquo; Louis panted, his tongue stuttering with terror. &lsquo;They
      are flogging him. They are killing him! To make him tell!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle grasped the sundial and leant against it, her face
      colourless; and, for an instant, I thought that she was fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell?&rsquo; I said mechanically. &lsquo;But he cannot tell. He is dumb, man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will make him guide them,&rsquo; Louis groaned, covering his ears with his
      shaking hands, his face the colour of paper. &lsquo;And his cries! Oh, Monsieur,
      go, go!&rsquo; he continued, in a thrilling tone. &lsquo;Save him. All through tie
      wood I heard his cries. It was horrible! horrible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle uttered a moan of pain; and I turned to support her, thinking
      each second to see her fall. But with a sudden movement she straightened
      herself, and, quickly slipping by me, with eyes that seemed to see
      nothing, she set off swiftly down the walk towards the meadow gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran after her; but, taken by surprise as I was, it was only by a great
      effort I reached the gate before her, and thrusting myself in the road,
      barred the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me pass!&rsquo; she panted, striving to thrust me on one side. &lsquo;Out of my
      way, sir! I am going to the village.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not going to the village,&rsquo; I said sternly. &lsquo;Go back; to the
      house, Mademoiselle, and at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My servant!&rsquo; she wailed. &lsquo;Let me go! Let me go! Do you think I can rest
      here while they torture him? He cannot speak, and they&mdash;they&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go back, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said, with decision. &lsquo;Your presence would only
      make matters worse! I will go myself, and what one man can do against
      many, I will! Louis, give your mistress your arm and take her to the
      house. Take her to Madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you will go?&rsquo; she cried. And before I could stay her&mdash;I swear I
      would have stopped her if I could&mdash;she raised my hand and carried it
      to her trembling lips. &lsquo;You will go! Go and stop them! Stop them, and
      Heaven reward you, Monsieur!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not answer; nay, I did not once look back, as I crossed the meadow;
      but I did not look forward either. Doubtless it was grass I trod, and the
      wood was before me with the sun shining aslant on it; doubtless the house
      rose behind me with a flame here and there in the windows. But I went in a
      dream, among shadows; with a racing pulse, in a glow from head to heel;
      conscious of nothing but the touch of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s warm lips on my hand,
      seeing neither meadow nor house, nor even the dark fringe of wood before
      me, but only Mademoiselle&rsquo;s passionate face. For the moment I was drunk:
      drunk with that to which I had been so long a stranger, with that which a
      man may scorn for years, to find it at last beyond his reach drunk with
      the touch of a good woman&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the bridge in this state; and my feet were among the brushwood
      before the heat and fervour in which I moved found on a sudden their
      direction. Something began to penetrate to my veiled senses&mdash;a hoarse
      inarticulate cry, now deep, now shrilling horribly, that of itself seemed
      to fill the wood. It came at intervals of half a minute or so, and made
      the flesh creep, it rang so full of dumb pain, of impotent wrestling, of
      unspeakable agony. I am a man and have seen things. I saw the Concini
      beheaded, and Chalais ten years later&mdash;they gave him thirty-four
      blows; and when I was a boy I escaped from the college and viewed from a
      great distance Ravaillac torn by horses&mdash;that was in the year ten.
      But the horrible cries I now heard, filled me, perhaps because I was alone
      and fresh from the sight of Mademoiselle, with loathing inexpressible. The
      very wood, though the sun had not yet set, seemed to grow dark. I ran on
      through it, cursing, until the hovels of the village came in sight. Again
      the shriek rose, a pulsing horror, and this time I could hear the lash
      fall on the sodden flesh, I could see in fancy the dumb man, trembling,
      quivering, straining against his bonds. And then, in a moment, I was in
      the street, and, as the scream once more tore the air, I dashed round the
      corner by the inn, and came upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not look at HIM, but I saw Captain Larolle and the Lieutenant, and a
      ring of troopers, and one man, bare-armed, teasing out with his fingers
      the thongs of a whip. The thongs dripped blood, and the sight fired the
      mine. The rage I had suppressed when the Lieutenant bearded me earlier in
      the afternoon, the passion with which Mademoiselle&rsquo;s distress had filled
      my breast, on the instant found vent. I sprang through the line of
      soldiers; and striking the man with the whip a buffet between the
      shoulders, which hurled him breathless to the ground, I turned on the
      leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You fiends!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Shame on you! The man is dumb! Dumb; and if I had
      ten men with me, I would sweep you and your scum out of the village with
      broomsticks. Lay on another lash,&rsquo; I continued recklessly, &lsquo;and I will see
      whether you or the Cardinal be the stronger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant stared at me, his grey moustache bristling, his eyes almost
      starting from his head. Some of the troopers laid their hands on their
      swords, but no one moved, and only the Captain spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MILLE DIABLES!&rsquo; he swore. &lsquo;What is all this about? Are you mad, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mad or sane!&rsquo; I cried furiously. &lsquo;Lay on another lash, and you shall
      repent it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant there was a pause of astonishment. Then, to my surprise,
      the Captain laughed&mdash;laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very heroic,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Quite magnificent, M. Chevalier-errant. But you
      see, unfortunately, you come too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too late,&rsquo; I said incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, too late,&rsquo; he replied, with a mocking smile. And the Lieutenant
      grinned too. &lsquo;Unfortunately, you see, the man has just confessed. We have
      only been giving him an extra touch or two, to impress his memory, and
      save us the trouble of lashing him up again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; I said bluntly&mdash;but I felt the check, and fell
      to earth. &lsquo;The man cannot speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but he has managed to tell us what we want; that he will guide us to
      the place we are seeking,&rsquo; the Captain answered drily. &lsquo;The whip, if it
      cannot find a man a tongue, can find him wits. What is more, I think that
      he will keep his word,&rsquo; he continued, with a hideous scowl. &lsquo;For I warn
      him that if he does not, all your heroics shall not save him. He is a
      rebel dog, and known to us of old; and I will flay his back to the bones,
      ay, until we can see his heart beating through his ribs, but I will have
      what I want&mdash;in your teeth, too, you d&mdash;&mdash;d meddler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady, steady!&rsquo; I said, sobered. I saw that he was telling the truth.
      &lsquo;Is he going to take you to M. de Cocheforet&rsquo;s hiding-place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is!&rsquo; the Captain retorted. &lsquo;Have you any objection to that,
      Master Spy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;Only I shall go with you. And if you live three
      months, I shall kill you for that name-behind the barracks at Auch, M. le
      Capitaine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed colour, but he answered me boldly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that you will go with us,&rsquo; he said, with a snarl. &lsquo;That is
      as we please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the Cardinal&rsquo;s orders,&rsquo; I said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Cardinal?&rsquo; he exclaimed, stung to fury by this repetition of the
      name. &lsquo;The Cardinal be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Lieutenant laid his hand on his lips and stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; he said. Then more quietly, &lsquo;Your pardon, M. le Capitaine; but the
      least said the soonest mended. Shall I give orders to the men to fall in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain nodded sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant turned to his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take him down!&rsquo; he commanded in his harsh, monotonous voice. &lsquo;Throw his
      blouse over him, and tie his hands. And do you two, Paul and Lebrun, guard
      him. Michel, bring the whip, or he may forget how it tastes. Sergeant,
      choose four good men, and dismiss the rest to their quarters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we need the horses?&rsquo; the sergeant asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; the Captain answered peevishly. &lsquo;What does the rogue say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant stepped up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; he said grimly. &lsquo;Nod if you mean yes, and shake your head if you
      mean no. And have a care you answer truly. Is it more than a mile to this
      place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had loosened the poor wretch&rsquo;s fastenings, and covered his back. He
      stood leaning his shoulder against the wall, his mouth still panting, the
      sweat running down his hollow cheeks. His sunken eyes were closed, but a
      quiver now and again ran through his frame. The Lieutenant repeated his
      question, and, getting no answer, looked round for orders. The Captain met
      the look, and crying savagely, &lsquo;Answer will you, you mule!&rsquo; struck the
      half-swooning miserable across the back with his switch. The effect was
      magical. Covered, as his shoulders were, the man sprang erect with a
      shriek of pain, raising his chin, and hollowing his back; and in that
      attitude stood an instant with starting eyes, gasping for breath. Then he
      sank back against the wall, moving his mouth spasmodically. His face was
      the colour of lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Diable! I think that we have gone too far with him!&rsquo; the Captain
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring some wine!&rsquo; the Lieutenant replied. &lsquo;Quick with it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked on, burning with indignation, and in some excitement besides. For
      if the man took them to the place, and they succeeded in seizing
      Cocheforet, there was an end of the matter as far as I was concerned. It
      was off my shoulders, and I might leave the village when I pleased; nor
      was it likely&mdash;since he would have his man, though not through me&mdash;that
      the Cardinal would refuse to grant me an amnesty. On the whole, I thought
      that he would prefer that things should take this course; and assuming the
      issue, I began to wonder whether it would be necessary in that event that
      Madame should know the truth. I had a kind of vision of a reformed
      Berault, dead to play and purging himself at a distance from Zaton&rsquo;s;
      winning, perhaps, a name in the Italian war, and finally&mdash;but, pshaw!
      I was a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, be these things as they might, it was essential that I should see
      the arrest made; and I waited patiently while they revived the tortured
      man, and made their dispositions. These took some time; so that the sun
      was down, and it was growing dusk when we marched out, Clon going first,
      supported by his two guards, the Captain and I following&mdash;abreast,
      and eyeing one another suspiciously; the Lieutenant, with the sergeant and
      five troopers, bringing up the rear. Clon moved slowly, moaning from time
      to time; and but for the aid given him by the two men with him, must have
      sunk down again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way out between two houses close to the inn, and struck a
      narrow track, scarcely discernible, which ran behind other houses, and
      then plunged into the thickest part of the wood. A single person,
      traversing the covert, might have made such a track; or pigs, or children.
      But it was the first idea that occurred to us, and put us all on the
      alert. The Captain carried a cocked pistol, I held my sword drawn, and
      kept a watchful eye on HIM; and the deeper the dusk fell in the wood, the
      more cautiously we went, until at last we came out with a sort of jump
      into a wider and lighter path.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up and down, and saw behind me a vista of tree-trunks, before me
      a wooden bridge and an open meadow, lying cold and grey in the twilight;
      and I stood in astonishment. We were in the old path to the Chateau! I
      shivered at the thought that he was going to take us there, to the house,
      to Mademoiselle!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain also recognised the place, and swore aloud. But the dumb man
      went on unheeding until he reached the wooden bridge. There he stopped
      short, and looked towards the dark outline of the house, which was just
      visible, one faint light twinkling sadly in the west wing. As the Captain
      and I pressed up behind him, he raised his hands and seemed to wring them
      towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a care!&rsquo; the Captain growled. &lsquo;Play me no tricks, or&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence, for Clon, as if he well understood his
      impatience, turned back from the bridge, and, entering the wood to the
      left, began to ascend the bank of the stream. We had not gone a hundred
      yards before the ground grew rough, and the undergrowth thick; and yet
      through all ran a kind of path which enabled us to advance, dark as it was
      now growing. Very soon the bank on which we moved began to rise above the
      water, and grew steep and rugged. We turned a shoulder, where the stream
      swept round a curve, and saw we were in the mouth of a small ravine, dark
      and sheer-sided. The water brawled along the bottom, over boulders and
      through chasms. In front, the slope on which we stood shaped itself into a
      low cliff; but halfway between its summit and the water a ledge, or narrow
      terrace, running along the face, was dimly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ten to one, a cave!&rsquo; the Captain muttered. &lsquo;It is a likely place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And an ugly one!&rsquo; I replied with a sneer. &lsquo;Which one against ten might
      hold for hours!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the ten had no pistols&mdash;yes!&rsquo; he answered viciously. &lsquo;But you see
      we have. Is he going that way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was. As soon as this was clear, Larolle turned to his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lieutenant,&rsquo; he said, speaking in a low voice, though the chafing of the
      stream below us covered ordinary sounds; &lsquo;what say you? Shall we light the
      lanthorns, or press on while there is still a glimmering of day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On, I should say, M. le Capitaine,&rsquo; the Lieutenant answered. &lsquo;Prick him
      in the back if he falters. I will warrant,&rsquo; the brute added with a
      chuckle, &lsquo;he has a tender place or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain gave the word and we moved forward. It was evident now that
      the cliff-path was our destination. It was possible for the eye to follow
      the track all the way to it, through rough stones and brushwood; and
      though Clon climbed feebly, and with many groans, two minutes saw us step
      on to it. It did not prove to be, in fact, the perilous place it looked at
      a distance. The ledge, grassy and terrace-like, sloped slightly downwards
      and outwards, and in parts was slippery; but it was as wide as a highway,
      and the fall to the water did not exceed thirty feet. Even in such a dim
      light as now displayed it to us, and by increasing the depth and unseen
      dangers of the gorge gave a kind of impressiveness to our movements, a
      nervous woman need not have feared to tread it, I wondered how often
      Mademoiselle had passed along it with her milk-pitcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that we have him now,&rsquo; Captain Larolle muttered, twisting his
      moustachios, and looking about to make his last dispositions. &lsquo;Paul and
      Lebrun, see that your man makes no noise. Sergeant, come forward with your
      carbine, but do not fire without orders. Now, silence all, and close up,
      Lieutenant. Forward!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We advanced about a hundred paces, keeping the cliff on our left, turned a
      shoulder, and saw, a few paces in front of us, a slight hollow, a black
      blotch in the grey duskiness of the cliff-side. The prisoner stopped, and,
      raising his bound hands, pointed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There?&rsquo; the Captain whispered, pressing forward. &lsquo;Is it the place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clon nodded. The Captain&rsquo;s voice shook with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paul and Lebrun remain here with the prisoner,&rsquo; he said, in a low tone.
      &lsquo;Sergeant, come forward with me. Now, are you ready? Forward!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word he and the sergeant passed quickly, one on either side of Clon
      and his guards. The path grew narrow here, and the Captain passed outside.
      The eyes of all but one were on the black blotch, the hollow in the
      cliff-side, expecting we knew not what&mdash;a sudden shot or the rush or
      a desperate man; and no one saw exactly what happened. But somehow, as the
      Captain passed abreast of him, the prisoner thrust back his guards, and
      leaping sideways, flung his unbound arms round Larolle&rsquo;s body, and in an
      instant swept him, shouting, to the verge of the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done in a moment. By the time our startled wits and eyes were back
      with them, the two were already tottering on the edge, looking in the
      gloom like one dark form. The sergeant, who was the first to find his
      head, levelled his carbine, but, as the wrestlers twirled and twisted, the
      Captain, shrieking out oaths and threats, the mute silent as death, it was
      impossible to see which was which, and the sergeant lowered his gun again,
      while the men held back nervously. The ledge sloped steeply there, the
      edge was vague, already the two seemed to be wrestling in mid air; and the
      mute was desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment of hesitation was fatal. Clon&rsquo;s long arms were round the
      other&rsquo;s arms, crushing them into his ribs; Clon&rsquo;s skull-like face grinned
      hate into the other&rsquo;s eyes; his bony limbs curled round him like the folds
      of a snake. Larolle&rsquo;s strength gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn you all! Why don&rsquo;t you come up?&rsquo; he cried. And then, &lsquo;Ah! Mercy!
      mercy!&rsquo; came in one last scream from his lips. As the Lieutenant, taken
      aback before, sprang forward to his aid, the two toppled over the edge,
      and in a second hurtled out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MON DIEU!&rsquo; the Lieutenant cried; the answer was a dull splash in the
      depths below. He flung up his arms. &lsquo;Water!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Quick, men, get
      down. We may save him yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no path, and night was come, and the men&rsquo;s nerves were
      shaken. The lanthorns had to be lit, and the way to be retraced; by the
      time we reached the dark pool which lay below, the last bubbles were gone
      from the surface, the last ripples had beaten themselves out against the
      banks. The pool still rocked sullenly, and the yellow light showed a man&rsquo;s
      hat floating, and near it a glove three parts submerged. But that was all.
      The mute&rsquo;s dying grip had known no loosening, nor his hate any fear. I
      heard afterwards that when they dragged the two out next day, his fingers
      were in the other&rsquo;s eye-sockets, his teeth in his throat. If ever man
      found death sweet, it was he!
    </p>
    <p>
      As we turned slowly from the black water, some shuddering, some crossing
      themselves, the Lieutenant looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curse you!&rsquo; he said passionately. &lsquo;I believe that you are glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He deserved his fate,&rsquo; I answered coldly. &lsquo;Why should I pretend to be
      sorry? It was now or in three months. And for the other poor devil&rsquo;s sake
      I am glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glared at me for a moment in speechless anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, &lsquo;I should like to have you tied up!&rsquo; he said between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think that you had had enough of tying up for one day!&rsquo; I
      retorted. &lsquo;But there,&rsquo; I went on contemptuously, &lsquo;it comes of making
      officers out of the canaille. Dogs love blood. The teamster must lash
      something if he can no longer lash his horses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were back, a sombre little procession, at the wooden bridge when I said
      this. He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he replied, nodding viciously. &lsquo;That decides me. Sergeant,
      light me this way with a lanthorn. The rest of you to the village. Now,
      Master Spy,&rsquo; he continued, glancing at me with gloomy spite, &lsquo;Your road is
      my road. I think I know how to spoil your game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders in disdain, and together, the sergeant leading the
      way with the light, we crossed the dim meadow, and passed through the gate
      where Mademoiselle had kissed my hand, and up the ghostly walk between the
      rose bushes. I wondered uneasily what the Lieutenant would be at, and what
      he intended; but the lanthorn-light which now fell on the ground at our
      feet, and now showed one of us to the other, high-lit in a frame of
      blackness, discovered nothing in his grizzled face but settled hostility.
      He wheeled at the end of the walk to go to the main door, but as he did so
      I saw the flutter of a white skirt by the stone seat against the house,
      and I stepped that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle?&rsquo; I said softly. &lsquo;Is it you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clon?&rsquo; she muttered, her voice quivering. &lsquo;What of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is past pain,&rsquo; I answered gently. &lsquo;He is dead&mdash;yes, dead,
      Mademoiselle, but in his own way. Take comfort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stifled a sob; then before I could say more, the Lieutenant, with his
      sergeant and light, were at my elbow. He saluted Mademoiselle roughly. She
      looked at him with shuddering abhorrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you come to flog me too, sir?&rsquo; she said passionately. &lsquo;Is it not
      enough that you have murdered my servant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, it was he who killed my Captain,&rsquo; the Lieutenant
      answered, in another tone than I had expected. &lsquo;If your servant is dead so
      is my comrade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Larolle?&rsquo; she murmured, gazing with startled eyes, not at him but
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clon flung the Captain and himself&mdash;into the river pool above the
      bridge,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a low cry of awe and stood silent; but her lips moved and I
      think that she prayed for Clon, though she was a Huguenot. Meanwhile, I
      had a fright. The lanthorn, swinging in the sergeant&rsquo;s hand, and throwing
      its smoky light now on the stone seat, now on the rough wall above it,
      showed me something else. On the seat, doubtless where Mademoiselle&rsquo;s hand
      had lain as she sat in the dark, listening and watching and shivering,
      stood a pitcher of food. Beside her, in that place, it was damning
      evidence, and I trembled least the Lieutenant&rsquo;s eye should fall upon it,
      lest the sergeant should see it; and then, in a moment, I forgot all about
      it. The Lieutenant was speaking and his voice was doom. My throat grew dry
      as I listened; my tongue stuck to my mouth I tried to look at
      Mademoiselle, but I could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true that the Captain is gone,&rsquo; he said stiffly, &lsquo;but others are
      alive, and about one of them a word with you, by your leave, Mademoiselle.
      I have listened to a good deal of talk from this fine gentleman friend of
      yours. He has spent the last twenty-four hours saying &ldquo;You shall!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;You shall not!&rdquo; He came from you and took a very high tone because we
      laid a little whip-lash about that dumb devil of yours. He called us
      brutes and beasts, and but for him I am not sure that my friend would not
      now be alive. But when he said a few minutes ago that he was glad&mdash;glad
      of it, d&mdash;him!&mdash;then I fixed it in my mind that I would be even
      with him. And I am going to be!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; Mademoiselle asked, wearily interrupting him. &lsquo;If you
      think that you can prejudice me against this gentleman&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is precisely what I am going to do! And a little more than that!&rsquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be only wasting your breath!&rsquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait! Wait, Mademoiselle&mdash;-until you have heard,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;For I
      swear to you that if ever a black-hearted scoundrel, a dastardly sneaking
      spy trod the earth, it is this fellow! And I am going to expose him. Your
      own eyes and your own ears shall persuade you. I am not particular, but I
      would not eat, I would not drink, I would not sit down with him! I would
      rather be beholden to the meanest trooper in my squadron than to him! Ay,
      I would, so help me Heaven!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Lieutenant, turning squarely on his heel, spat on the ground.

      CHAPTER XI. THE ARREST
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had come, and I saw no way of escape. The sergeant was between us and I
      could not strike him. And I found no words. A score of times I had thought
      with shrinking how I should reveal my secret to Mademoiselle&mdash;what I
      should say, and how she would take it; but in my mind it had been always a
      voluntary act, this disclosure, it had been always I who unmasked myself
      and she who listened&mdash;alone; and in this voluntariness and this
      privacy there had been something which took from the shame of
      anticipation. But here&mdash;here was no voluntary act on my part, no
      privacy, nothing but shame. And I stood mute, convicted, speechless, under
      her eyes&mdash;like the thing I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if anything could have braced me it was Mademoiselle&rsquo;s voice when she
      answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, Monsieur,&rsquo; she said calmly, &lsquo;you will have done the sooner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not believe me?&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Then, I say, look at him! Look at
      him! If ever shame&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; she said abruptly&mdash;she did not look at me, &lsquo;I am ashamed
      of myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t hear me,&rsquo; the Lieutenant rejoined hotly. &lsquo;His very name is
      not his own! He is not Barthe at all. He is Berault, the gambler, the
      duellist, the bully; whom if you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; she said coldly. &lsquo;I know it all; and if you have nothing more
      to tell me, go, Monsieur. Go!&rsquo; she continued in a tone of infinite scorn.
      &lsquo;Be satisfied, that you have earned my contempt as well as my abhorrence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked for a moment taken aback. Then,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, but I have more,&rsquo; he cried, his voice stubbornly triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot that you would think little of that. I forgot that a swordsman
      has always the ladies&rsquo; hearts&mdash;-but I have more. Do you know, too,
      that he is in the Cardinal&rsquo;s pay? Do you know that he is here on the same
      errand which brings us here&mdash;to arrest M. de Cocheforet? Do you know
      that while we go about the business openly and in soldier fashion, it is
      his part to worm himself into your confidence, to sneak into Madame&rsquo;s
      intimacy, to listen at your door, to follow your footsteps, to hang on
      your lips, to track you&mdash;track you until you betray yourselves and
      the man? Do you know this, and that all his sympathy is a lie,
      Mademoiselle? His help, so much bait to catch the secret? His aim
      blood-money&mdash;blood-money? Why, MORBLEU!&rsquo; the Lieutenant continued,
      pointing his finger at me, and so carried away by passion, so lifted out
      of himself by wrath and indignation, that I shrank before him&mdash;&lsquo;you
      talk, lady, of contempt and abhorrence in the same breath with me, but
      what have you for him&mdash;what have you for him&mdash;the spy, the
      informer, the hired traitor? And if you doubt me, if you want evidence,
      look at him. Only look at him, I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he might say it; for I stood silent still, cowering and despairing,
      white with rage and hate. But Mademoiselle did not look. She gazed
      straight at the Lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you done?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done?&rsquo; he stammered; her words, her air, bringing him to earth again.
      &lsquo;Done? Yes, if you believe me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; she answered proudly. &lsquo;If that be all, be satisfied, Monsieur.
      I do not believe you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then tell me this,&rsquo; he retorted, after a moment of stunned surprise.
      &lsquo;Answer me this! Why, if he was not on our side, do you think that we let
      him remain here? Why did we suffer him to stay in a suspected house,
      bullying us, annoying us, thwarting us, taking your part from hour to
      hour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a sword, Monsieur,&rsquo; she answered with fine contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MILLE DIABLES!&rsquo; he cried, snapping his fingers in a rage. &lsquo;That for his
      sword! It was because he held the Cardinal&rsquo;s commission, I tell you,
      because he had equal authority with us. Because we had no choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that being so, Monsieur, why are you now betraying him?&rsquo; she asked.
      He swore at that, feeling the stroke go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must be mad!&rsquo; he said, glaring at her. &lsquo;Cannot you see that the man
      is what I tell you? Look at him! Look at him, I say! Listen to him! Has he
      a word to say for himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is late,&rsquo; she replied coldly. &lsquo;And I am not very well. If you have
      done, quite done&mdash;perhaps, you will leave me, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MON DIEU! he exclaimed, shrugging his shoulders, and grinding his teeth
      in impotent rage. You are mad! I have told you the truth, and you will not
      believe it. Well&mdash;on your head be it then, Mademoiselle. I have no
      more to say! You will see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, without more, fairly conquered by her staunchness, he
      saluted her, gave the word to the sergeant, turned and went down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant went after him, the lanthorn swaying in his hand. And we two
      were left alone. The frogs were croaking in the pool, a bat flew round in
      circles; the house, the garden, all lay quiet under the darkness, as on
      the night which I first came to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And would to Heaven I had never come that was the cry in my heart. Would
      to Heaven I had never seen this woman, whose nobleness and faith were a
      continual shame to me; a reproach branding me every hour I stood in her
      presence with all vile and hateful names. The man just gone, coarse,
      low-bred, brutal soldier as he was, manflogger and drilling-block, had yet
      found heart to feel my baseness, and words in which to denounce it. What,
      then, would she say, when the truth came home to her? What shape should I
      take in her eyes then? How should I be remembered through all the years
      then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then? But now? What was she thinking now, at this moment as she stood
      silent and absorbed near the stone seat, a shadowy figure with face turned
      from me? Was she recalling the man&rsquo;s words, fitting them to the facts and
      the past, adding this and that circumstance? Was she, though she had
      rebuffed him in the body, collating, now he was gone, all that he had
      said, and out of these scraps piecing together the damning truth? Was she,
      for all that she had said, beginning to see me as I was? The thought
      tortured me. I could brook uncertainty no longer. I went nearer to her and
      touched her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said in a voice which sounded hoarse and unnatural even
      in my own ears, &lsquo;do you believe this of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She started violently, and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, Monsieur!&rsquo; she murmured, passing her hand over her brow; &lsquo;I had
      forgotten that you were here. Do I believe what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What that man said of me,&rsquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That!&rsquo; she exclaimed. And then she stood a moment gazing at me in a
      strange fashion. &lsquo;Do I believe that, Monsieur? But come, come!&rsquo; she
      continued impetuously. &lsquo;Come, and I will show you if I believe it. But not
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned as she spoke, and led the way on the instant into the house
      through the parlour door, which stood half open. The room inside was pitch
      dark, but she took me fearlessly by the hand and led me quickly through
      it, and along the passage, until we came to the cheerful lighted hall,
      where a great fire burned on the hearth. All traces of the soldiers&rsquo; 
      occupation had been swept away. But the room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led me to the fire, and there in the full light, no longer a shadowy
      creature, but red-lipped, brilliant, throbbing with life and beauty, she
      stood opposite me&mdash;her eyes shining, her colour high, her breast
      heaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I believe it?&rsquo; she said in a thrilling voice. &lsquo;I will tell you. M. de
      Cocheforet&rsquo;s hiding-place is in the hut behind the fern-stack, two
      furlongs beyond the village on the road to Auch. You know now what no one
      else knows, he and I and Madame excepted. You hold in your hands his life
      and my honour; and you know also, M. de Berault, whether I believe that
      tale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; I cried. And I stood looking at her until something of the
      horror in my eyes crept into hers, and she shuddered and stepped back from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? What is it?&rsquo; she whispered, clasping her hands. And with all
      the colour gone suddenly from her cheeks she peered trembling into the
      corners and towards the door. &lsquo;There is no one here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I forced myself to speak, though I was trembling all over like a man in an
      ague. &lsquo;No, Mademoiselle, there is no one here,&rsquo; I muttered. &lsquo;There is no
      one here.&rsquo; And then I let my head fall on my breast, and I stood before
      her, the statue of despair. Had she felt a grain of suspicion, a grain of
      doubt, my bearing must have opened her eyes; but her mind was cast in so
      noble a mould that, having once thought ill of me and been converted, she
      could feel no doubt again. She must trust all in all. A little recovered
      from her fright, she stood looking at me in great wonder; and at last she
      had a thought&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not well?&rsquo; she said suddenly. &lsquo;It is your old wound, Monsieur.
      Now I have it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I muttered faintly, &lsquo;it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will call Clon!&rsquo; she cried impetuously. And then, with a sob: &lsquo;Ah! poor
      Clon! He is gone. But there is still Louis. I will call him and he will
      get you something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gone from the room before I could stop her, and I stood leaning
      against the table possessor at last of the secret which I had come so far
      to win; able in a moment to open the door and go out into the night, and
      make use of it&mdash;and yet the most unhappy of men. The sweat stood on
      my brow; my eyes wandered round the room; I turned towards the door, with
      some mad thought of flight&mdash;of flight from her, from the house, from
      everything; and I had actually taken a step towards this, when on the
      door, the outer door, there came a sudden hurried knocking which jarred
      every nerve in my body. I started, and stopped. I stood a moment in the
      middle of the floor gazing at the door, as at a ghost. Then, glad of
      action, glad of anything that might relieve the tension of my feelings, I
      strode to it and pulled it sharply open.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the threshold, his flushed face lit up by the light behind me, stood
      one of the knaves whom I had brought with me to Auch. He had been running,
      and panted heavily; but he had kept his wits, and the instant I, appeared
      he grasped my sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Monsieur, the very man!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Quick! come this instant, lose
      not a moment, and you may yet be first. They have the secret! The soldiers
      have found Monsieur!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Found him?&rsquo; I echoed. &lsquo;M. de Cocheforet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but they know the place where he lies. It was found by accident. The
      Lieutenant was gathering his men when I came away. If we are quick, we may
      yet be first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the place?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not hear,&rsquo; he answered bluntly. &lsquo;We must hang on their skirts,
      and at the last moment strike in. It is the only way, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair of pistols I had taken from the shock-headed man lay on a chest
      by the door. Without waiting for more I snatched them up and my hat, and
      joined him, and in a moment we were running down the garden. I looked back
      once before we passed the gate, and I saw the light streaming out through
      the door which. I had left open; and I fancied that for an instant a
      figure darkened the gap. But the fancy only strengthened the one single
      purpose, the iron resolve, which had taken possession of me and all my
      thoughts. I must be first; I must anticipate the Lieutenant; I must make
      the arrest myself. I must be first. And I ran on only the faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were across the meadow and in the wood in a moment. There, instead of
      keeping along the common path, I boldly singled out&mdash;my senses seemed
      to be preternaturally keen&mdash;the smaller trail by which Clon had
      brought us. Along this I ran unfalteringly, avoiding logs and pitfalls as
      by instinct, and following all its turns and twists, until we came to the
      back of the inn, and could hear the murmur of subdued voices in the
      village street, the sharp low word of command, and the clink of weapons;
      and could see over and between the houses the dull glare of lanthorns and
      torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grasped my man&rsquo;s arm, and crouched down listening. When I had heard
      enough, &lsquo;Where is your mate?&rsquo; I said in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With them,&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come,&rsquo; I whispered rising. &lsquo;I have seen what I want. Let us go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he caught me by the arm and detained me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know the way,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Steady, steady, Monsieur. You go too
      fast. They are just moving. Let us join them, and strike in when the time
      comes. We must let them guide us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fool!&rsquo; I said, shaking off his hand. &lsquo;I tell you, I know where he is! I
      know where they are going. Come, and we will pluck the fruit while they
      are on the road to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His only answer was an exclamation of surprise. At that moment the lights
      began to move. The Lieutenant was starting. The moon was not yet up, the
      sky was grey and cloudy; to advance where we were was to step into a wall
      of blackness. But we had lost too much already, and I did not hesitate.
      Bidding my companion follow me and use his legs, I sprang through a low
      fence which rose before us; then stumbling blindly over some broken ground
      in the rear of the houses, I came with a fall or two to a little
      watercourse with steep sides. Through this I plunged recklessly and up the
      farther side, and, breathless and panting, gained the road, beyond the
      village, and fifty yards in advance of the Lieutenant&rsquo;s troop.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had only two lanthorns burning, and we were beyond the circle of
      light cast by these; while the steady tramp of so many footsteps covered
      the noise we made. We were in no danger of being noticed, and in a
      twinkling we turned our backs, and as fast as we could we ran down the
      road. Fortunately, they were thinking more of secrecy than speed, and in a
      minute we had doubled the distance between them and us. In two minutes
      their lights were mere sparks shining in the gloom behind us. We lost even
      the tramp of their feet. Then I began to look out and go more slowly,
      peering into the shadows on either side for the fernstack.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one hand the hill rose steeply, on the other it fell away to the
      stream. On neither side was close wood, or my difficulties had been
      immensely increased; but scattered oak trees stood here and there among
      the bracken. This helped me, and presently, on the upper side, I came upon
      the dense substance of the stack looming black against the lighter hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart beat fast, but it was no time for thought. Bidding the man in a
      whisper to follow me and be ready to back me up, I climbed the bank
      softly, and, with a pistol in my hand, felt my way to the rear of the
      stack, thinking to find a hut there, set against the fern, and M.
      Cocheforet in it. But I found no hut. There was none; and, moreover, it
      was so dark now we were off the road, that it came upon me suddenly, as I
      stood between the hill and the stack, that I had undertaken a very
      difficult thing. The hut behind the fern stack. But how far behind? how
      far from it? The dark slope stretched above us, infinite, immeasurable
      shrouded in night. To begin to climb it in search of a tiny hut, possibly
      well hidden and hard to find in daylight, seemed an endeavour as hopeless
      as to meet with the needle in the hay! And now while I stood, chilled and
      doubting, almost despairing, the steps of the troop in the road began to
      grow audible, began to come nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Monsieur le Capitaine?&rsquo; the man beside me muttered&mdash;in wonder
      why I stood. &lsquo;Which way? or they will be before us yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to think, to reason it out; to consider where the hut should be;
      while the wind sighed through the oaks, and here and there I could hear an
      acorn fall. But the thing pressed too close on me; my thoughts would not
      be hurried, and at last I said at a venture,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up the hill. Straight up from the stack.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not demur, and we plunged at the ascent, knee-deep in bracken and
      furze, sweating at every pore with our exertions, and hearing the troop
      come every moment nearer on the road below. Doubtless they knew exactly
      whither to go! Forced to stop and take breath when we had scrambled up
      fifty yards or so, I saw their lanthorns shining like moving glow-worms; I
      could even hear the clink of steel. For all I could tell, the hut might be
      down there, and we be moving from it. But it was too late to go back now&mdash;they
      were close to the fern-stack; and in despair I turned to the hill again. A
      dozen steps and I stumbled. I rose and plunged on again; again stumbled.
      Then I found that I was treading level earth. And&mdash;was it water I saw
      before me, below me? or some mirage of the sky?
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither; and I gripped my fellow&rsquo;s arm, as he came abreast of me, and
      stopped him sharply. Below us in the middle of a steep hollow, a pit in
      the hill-side, a light shone out through some aperture and quivered on the
      mist, like the pale lamp of a moorland hobgoblin. It made itself visible,
      displaying nothing else; a wisp of light in the bottom of a black bowl.
      Yet my spirits rose with a great bound at sight of it; for I knew that I
      had stumbled on the place I sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the common run of things I should have weighed my next step carefully,
      and gone about it slowly. But here was no place for thought, nor room for
      delay; and I slid down the side of the hollow on the instant, and the
      moment my feet touched the bottom sprang to the door of the little hut,
      whence the light issued. A stone turned under my feet in my rush, and I
      fell on my knees on the threshold; but the fall only brought my face to a
      level with the face of the man who lay inside on a bed of fern. He had
      been reading. Startled by the sound I made, he dropped his book, and in a
      flash stretched out his hand for a weapon. But the muzzle of my pistol
      covered him, he was not in a posture from which he could spring, and at a
      sharp word from me he dropped his hand; the tigerish glare which flickered
      for an instant in his eyes gave place to a languid smile, and he shrugged
      his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;EH BIEN!,&rsquo; he said with marvellous composure. &lsquo;Taken at last! Well, I was
      tired of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are my prisoner, M. de Cocheforet,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Move a hand and I
      kill you. But you have still a choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truly?&rsquo; he said, raising his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. My orders are to take you to Paris alive or dead. Give me your
      parole that you will make no attempt to escape, and you shall go thither
      at your ease and as a gentleman. Refuse, and I shall disarm and bind you,
      and you go as a prisoner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What force have you?&rsquo; he asked curtly. He still lay on his elbow, his
      cloak covering him, the little Marot in which he had been reading close to
      his hand. But his quick black eyes, which looked the keener for the pallor
      and thinness of his face, roved ceaselessly over me, probed the darkness
      behind me, took note of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough to compel you, Monsieur,&rsquo; I replied sternly; &lsquo;but that is not all.
      There are thirty dragoons coming up the hill to secure you, and they will
      make you no such offer. Surrender to me before they come, and give me your
      parole, and I will do all I can for your comfort. Delay, and you must fall
      into their hands. There can be no escape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will take my word?&rsquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give it, and you may keep your pistols, M. de Cocheforet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me at least that you are not alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I give it,&rsquo; he said with a sigh. &lsquo;And for Heaven&rsquo;s sake get me
      something to eat and a bed. I am tired of this pig-sty. MON DIEU! it is a
      fortnight since I slept between sheets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall sleep to-night in your own house, if you please,&rsquo; I answered
      hurriedly. &lsquo;But here they come. Be good enough to stay where you are for a
      moment, and I will meet them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped out into the darkness, just as the Lieutenant, after posting his
      men round the hollow, slid down with a couple of sergeants to make the
      arrest. The place round the open door was pitch-dark. He had not espied my
      man, who had lodged himself in the deepest shadow of the hut, and when he
      saw me come out across the light he took me for Cocheforet. In a twinkling
      he thrust a pistol into my face, and cried triumphantly,&mdash;&lsquo;You are my
      prisoner!&rsquo; while one of the sergeants raised a lanthorn and threw its
      light into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What folly is this?&rsquo; I said savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant&rsquo;s jaw fell, and he stood for a moment paralysed with
      astonishment. Less than an hour before he had left me at the Chateau.
      Thence he had come hither with the briefest delay; yet he found me here
      before him. He swore fearfully, his face black, his moustachios stiff with
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this? What is it?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Where is the man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What man?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This Cocheforet!&rsquo; he roared, carried away by his passion. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to
      me! He is here, and I will have him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are too late,&rsquo; I said, watching him heedfully. &lsquo;M. de Cocheforet is
      here, but he has already surrendered to me, and is my prisoner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your prisoner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly!&rsquo; I answered, facing the man with all the harshness I could
      muster. &lsquo;I have arrested him by virtue of the Cardinal&rsquo;s commission
      granted to me. And by virtue of the same I shall keep him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will keep him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at me for a moment, utterly aghast; the picture of defeat. Then
      on a sudden I saw his face lighten with, a new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a d&mdash;d ruse!&rsquo; he shouted, brandishing his pistol like a
      madman. &lsquo;It is a cheat and a fraud! By God! you have no commission! I see
      through it! I see through it all! You have come here, and you have
      hocussed us! You are of their side, and this is your last shift to save
      him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What folly is this?&rsquo; I said contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No folly at all,&rsquo; he answered, perfect conviction in his tone. &lsquo;You have
      played upon us. You have fooled us. But I see through it now. An hour ago
      I exposed you to that fine Madame at the house there, and I thought it a
      marvel that she did not believe me. I thought it a marvel that she did not
      see through you, when you stood there before her, confounded, tongue-tied,
      a rogue convicted. But I understand now. She knew you. She was in the
      plot, and you were in the plot, and I, who thought that I was opening her
      eyes, was the only one fooled. But it is my turn now. You have played a
      bold part and a clever one,&rsquo; he continued, a sinister light in his little
      eyes,&rsquo; and I congratulate you. But it is at an end now, Monsieur. You took
      us in finely with your talk of Monseigneur, and his commission and your
      commission, and the rest. But I am not to be blinded any longer&mdash;or
      bullied. You have arrested him, have you? You have arrested him. Well, by
      G&mdash;, I shall arrest him, and I shall arrest you too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mad!&rsquo; I said staggered as much by this new view of the matter as
      by his perfect certainty. &lsquo;Mad, Lieutenant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was,&rsquo; he snarled. &lsquo;But I am sane now. I was mad when you imposed upon
      us, when you persuaded me to think that you were fooling the women to get
      the secret out of them, while all the time you were sheltering them,
      protecting them, aiding them, and hiding him&mdash;then I was mad. But not
      now. However, I ask your pardon. I thought you the cleverest sneak and the
      dirtiest hound Heaven ever made. I find you are cleverer than I thought,
      and an honest traitor. Your pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men, who stood about the rim of the bowl above us, laughed. I
      looked at the Lieutenant and could willingly have killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MON DIEU!&rsquo; I said&mdash;and I was so furious in my turn that I could
      scarcely speak. &lsquo;Do you say that I am an impostor&mdash;that I do not hold
      the Cardinal&rsquo;s commission?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do say that,&rsquo; he answered coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that I belong to the rebel party?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; he replied in the same tone. &lsquo;In fact,&rsquo; with a grin, &lsquo;I say that
      you are an honest man on the wrong side, M. de Berault. And you say that
      you are a scoundrel on the right. The advantage, however, is with me, and
      I shall back my opinion by arresting you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A ripple of coarse laughter ran round the hollow. The sergeant who held
      the lanthorn grinned, and a trooper at a distance called out of the
      darkness &lsquo;A BON CHAT BON RAT!&rsquo; This brought a fresh burst of laughter,
      while I stood speechless, confounded by the stubbornness, the crassness,
      the insolence of the man. &lsquo;You fool!&rsquo; I cried at last, &lsquo;you fool!&rsquo; And
      then M. de Cocheforet, who had come out of the hut and taken his stand at
      my elbow, interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me one moment,&rsquo; he said, airily, looking at the Lieutenant with
      raised eyebrows and pointing to me with his thumb, &lsquo;but I am puzzled
      between you. This gentleman&rsquo;s name? Is it de Berault or de Barthe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am M. de Berault,&rsquo; I said, brusquely, answering for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of Paris?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Monsieur, of Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not, then, the gentleman who has been honouring my poor house
      with his presence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; the Lieutenant struck in, grinning. &lsquo;He is that gentleman,
      too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I thought&mdash;I understood that that was M. de Barthe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am M. de Barthe, also,&rsquo; I retorted impatiently. &lsquo;What of that,
      Monsieur? It was my mother&rsquo;s name. I took it when I came down here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To&mdash;er&mdash;to arrest me, may I ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, doggedly; &lsquo;to arrest you. What of that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; he replied slowly and with a steady look at me&mdash;a look I
      could not meet. &lsquo;Except that, had I known this before, M. de Berault I
      should have thought longer before I surrendered to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant laughed, and I felt my cheek burn; but I affected to see
      nothing, and turned to him again. &lsquo;Now, Monsieur,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;are you
      satisfied?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered? &lsquo;I am not! You two may have rehearsed this pretty scene
      a dozen times. The word, it seems to me, is&mdash;Quick march, back to
      quarters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I found myself driven to play my last card; much against my
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I have my commission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Produce it!&rsquo; he replied incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think that I carry it with me?&rsquo; I cried in scorn. &lsquo;Do you think
      that when I came here, alone, and not with fifty dragoons at my back, I
      carried the Cardinal&rsquo;s seal in my pocket for the first lackey to find. But
      you shall have it. Where is that knave of mine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely out of my mouth before a ready hand thrust a paper
      into my fingers. I opened it slowly, glanced at it, and amid a pause of
      surprise gave it to the Lieutenant. He looked for a moment confounded.
      Then, with a last instinct of suspicion, he bade the sergeant hold up the
      lanthorn; and by its light he proceeded to spell through the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph!&rsquo; he ejaculated with an ugly look when he had come to the end, &lsquo;I
      see.&rsquo; And he read it aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;BY THESE PRESENTS, I COMMAND AND EMPOWER
    GILLES DE BERAULT, SIER DE BERAULT, TO
    SEEK FOR, HOLD, AND ARREST, AND DELIVER
    TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILLE THE BODY
    OF HENRI DE COCHEFORET, AND TO DO ALL
    ACTS AND THINGS AS SHALL BE NECESSARY
    TO EFFECT SUCH ARREST AND DELIVERY, FOR
    WHICH THESE SHALL BE HIS WARRANT.
    (Signed) THE CARDINAL DE RICHELIEU.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      When he had done&mdash;he read the signature with a peculiar intonation&mdash;someone
      said softly, &lsquo;VIVE LE ROI!&rsquo; and there was a moment&rsquo;s silence. The sergeant
      lowered his lanthorn. &lsquo;Is it enough?&rsquo; I said hoarsely, glaring from face
      to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant bowed stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For me?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Quite, Monsieur. I beg your pardon again. I find that
      my first impressions were the correct ones. Sergeant! give the gentleman
      his papers!&rsquo; and, turning his shoulder rudely, he tossed the commission to
      the sergeant, who gave it to me, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that the clown would not fight, and he had his men round him; and I
      had no choice but to swallow the insult. I put the paper in my breast,
      with as much indifference as I could assume; and as I did so, he gave a
      sharp order. The troopers began to form on the edge above; the men who had
      descended to climb the bank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the group behind him began to open and melt away, I caught sight of a
      white robe in the middle of it. The next moment, appearing with a
      suddenness which was like a blow on the cheek to me, Mademoiselle de
      Cocheforet glided forward towards me. She had a hood on her head, drawn
      low; and for a moment I could not see her face, I forgot her brother&rsquo;s
      presence at my elbow, I forgot other things, and, from habit and impulse
      rather than calculation, I took a step forward to meet her; though my
      tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth, and I was dumb and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she recoiled with such a look of white hate, of staring, frozen-eyed
      abhorrence, that I stepped back as if she had indeed struck me. It did not
      need the words which accompanied the look&mdash;the &lsquo;DO NOT TOUCH ME!&rsquo; 
      which she hissed at me as she drew her skirts together&mdash;to drive me
      to the farther edge of the hollow; where I stood with clenched teeth, and
      nails driven into the flesh, while she hung, sobbing tearless sobs, on her
      brother&rsquo;s neck.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE ROAD TO PARIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I remember hearing Marshal Bassompierre, who, of all the men within my
      knowledge, had the widest experience, say that not dangers but discomforts
      prove a man and show what he is; and that the worst sores in life are
      caused by crumpled rose-leaves and not by thorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am inclined to think him right, for I remember that when I came from my
      room on the morning after the arrest, and found hall and parlour and
      passage empty, and all the common rooms of the house deserted, and no meal
      laid; and when I divined anew from this discovery the feeling of the house
      towards me&mdash;however natural and to be expected&mdash;I remember that
      I felt as sharp a pang as when, the night before, I had had to face
      discovery and open rage and scorn. I stood in the silent, empty parlour,
      and looked on the familiar things with a sense of desolation, of something
      lost and gone, which I could not understand. The morning was grey and
      cloudy, the air sharp, a shower was falling. The rose-bushes outside
      swayed in the wind, and inside, where I could remember the hot sunshine
      lying on floor and table, the rain beat in and stained the boards. The
      inner door flapped and creaked on its hinges. I thought of other days and
      of meals I had taken there, and of the scent of flowers; and I fled to the
      hall in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, too, were no signs of life or company, no comfort, no
      attendance. The ashes of the logs, by whose blaze Mademoiselle had told me
      the secret, lay on the hearth white and cold fit emblem of the change that
      had taken place; and now and then a drop of moisture, sliding down the
      great chimney, pattered among them. The main door stood open, as if the
      house had no longer anything to guard. The only living thing to be seen
      was a hound which roamed about restlessly, now gazing at the empty hearth
      now lying down with pricked cars and watchful eyes. Some leaves, which had
      been blown in by the wind, rustled in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out moodily into the garden and wandered down one path and up
      another, looking at the dripping woods, and remembering things, until I
      came to the stone seat. On it, against the wall, trickling with raindrops,
      and with a dead leaf half filling its narrow neck, stood the pitcher of
      food. I thought how much had happened since Mademoiselle took her hand
      from it and the sergeant&rsquo;s lanthorn disclosed it to me; and, sighing
      grimly, I went in again through the parlour door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman was on her knees, on the hearth kindling the belated fire. She had
      her back to me, and I stood a moment looking at her doubtfully, wondering
      how she would bear herself and what she would say to me. Then she turned,
      and I started back, crying out her name in horror&mdash;for it was Madame!
      Madame de Cocheforet!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was plainly dressed, and her childish face was wan and piteous with
      weeping; but either the night had worn out her passion and drained her
      tears, or some great exigency had given her temporary calmness, for she
      was perfectly composed. She shivered as her eyes met mine, and she blinked
      as if a bright light had been suddenly thrust before her; but that was
      all, and she turned again to her task without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame! Madame!&rsquo; I cried in a frenzy of distress. &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The servants would not do it,&rsquo; she answered in a low but steady voice.
      &lsquo;You are still our guest, Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I cannot suffer it!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Madame de Cocheforet, I will not&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hand with a strange patient expression in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! please,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Hush! you trouble me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire blazed up as she spoke, and she rose slowly from it, and with a
      lingering look at it went out, leaving me to stand and stare and listen in
      the middle of the floor. Presently I heard her coming back along the
      passage, and she entered bearing a tray with wine and meat and bread. She
      set it down on the table, and with the same wan face, trembling always on
      the verge of tears, she began to lay out the things. The glasses clinked
      fitfully against the plates as she handled them; the knives jarred with
      one another. And I stood by, trembling myself; and endured this strange
      kind of penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She signed to me at last to sit down; and she went herself, and stood in
      the garden doorway with her back to me. I obeyed. I sat down. But though I
      had eaten nothing since the afternoon of the day before, I could not
      swallow. I fumbled with my knife, and drank; and grew hot and angry at
      this farce; and then looked through the window at the dripping bushes, and
      the rain and the distant sundial&mdash;and grew cold again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she turned round and came to my side. &lsquo;You do not eat,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw down my knife, and sprang up in a frenzy of passion. &lsquo;MON DIEU!
      Madame,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;do you think that I have NO heart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then in a moment I knew what I had done, what a folly I had committed.
      For in a moment she was on her knees on the floor, clasping my knees,
      pressing her wet cheeks to my rough clothes, crying to me for mercy&mdash;for
      life! life! his life! Oh, it was horrible! It was horrible to hear her
      gasping voice, to see her fair hair falling over my mud-stained boots, to
      mark her slender little form convulsed with sobs, to feel that it was a
      woman, a gentlewoman, who thus abased herself at my feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Madame! Madame!&rsquo; I cried in my pain, &lsquo;I beg you to rise. Rise, or I
      must go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His life! only his life!&rsquo; she moaned passionately. &lsquo;What had he done to
      you&mdash;that you should hunt him down? what have we done to you that you
      should slay us? Oh! have mercy! Have mercy! Let him go, and we will pray
      for you, I and my sister will pray for you, every morning and night of our
      lives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in terror lest someone should come and see her lying there, and I
      stooped and tried to raise her. But she only sank the lower, until her
      tender little hands touched the rowels of my spurs. I dared not move, At
      last I took a sudden resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen, then, Madame!&rsquo; I said almost sternly, &lsquo;if you will not rise. You
      forget everything, both how I stand, and how small my power is! You forget
      that if I were to release your husband to-day he would be seized within
      the hour by those who are still in the village and who are watching every
      road&mdash;who have not ceased to suspect my movements and my intentions.
      You forget, I say my circumstances&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She cut me short on that word. She sprang to her feet and faced me. One
      moment more and I should have said something to the purpose. But at that
      word she stood before me, white, breathless, dishevelled, struggling for
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rsquo; she panted eagerly. &lsquo;I know&mdash;I know!&rsquo; And she thrust
      her hand into her bosom and plucked something out and gave it to me&mdash;forced
      it upon me. &lsquo;I know&mdash;I know!&rsquo; she said again. &lsquo;Take it, and God
      reward you, Monsieur! God reward you! We give it freely&mdash;freely and
      thankfully!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood and looked at her and it; and slowly I froze. She had given me the
      packet&mdash;the packet I had restored to Mademoiselle&mdash;the parcel of
      jewels. I weighed it in my hands, and my heart grew hard again, for I knew
      that this was Mademoiselle&rsquo;s doing; that it was she who, mistrusting the
      effect of Madame&rsquo;s tears and prayers, had armed her with this last weapon&mdash;this
      dirty bribe. I flung it down on the table among the plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame!&rsquo; I cried ruthlessly, all my pity changed to anger, &lsquo;you mistake
      me altogether! I have heard hard words enough in the last twenty-four
      hours, and I know what you think of me! But you have yet to learn that I
      have never done one thing. I have never turned traitor to the hand that
      employed me, nor sold my own side! When I do so for a treasure ten times
      the worth of that, may my hand rot off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank on a seat with a moan of despair; and precisely at that moment M.
      de Cocheforet opened the door and came in. Over his shoulder I had a
      glimpse of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s proud face, a little whiter than of yore, with
      dark marks under the eyes, but like Satan&rsquo;s for coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; he said, frowning, as his eyes lighted on Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is&mdash;that we start at eleven o&rsquo;clock, Monsieur,&rsquo; I answered,
      bowing curtly. And I went out by the other door.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      That I might not be present at their parting I remained in the garden
      until the hour I had appointed was well past; and then, without entering
      the house, I went to the stable entrance. Here I found all in readiness,
      the two troopers whose company I had requisitioned as far as Auch, already
      in the saddle, my own two knaves waiting with my sorrel and M. de
      Cocheforet&rsquo;s chestnut. Another horse was being led up and down by Louis,
      and, alas! my heart moved at the sight, for it bore a lady&rsquo;s saddle. We
      were to have company then. Was it Madame who meant to come with us, or
      Mademoiselle? And how far? To Auch?
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that they had set some kind of a watch on me, for as I walked up
      M. de Cocheforet and his sister came out of the house; he with a pale face
      and bright eyes, and a twitching visible in his cheek&mdash;though he
      still affected a jaunty bearing; she wearing a black mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle accompanies us?&rsquo; I said formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your permission, Monsieur,&rsquo; he answered with bitter politeness. But
      I saw that he was choking with emotion; he had just parted from his wife,
      and I turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were all mounted he looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps&mdash;as you have my parole, you will permit me to ride alone?&rsquo; 
      he said with a little hesitation. &lsquo;And&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without me!&rsquo; I rejoined keenly. &lsquo;Assuredly, so far as is possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly I directed the troopers to ride before him, keeping out of
      earshot, while my two men followed him at a little distance with their
      carbines on their knees. Last of all, I rode myself with my eyes open and
      a pistol loose in my holster. M. de Cocheforet muttered a sneer at so many
      precautions and the mountain made of his request; but I had not done so
      much and come so far, I had not faced scorn and insults to be cheated of
      my prize at last; and aware that until we were beyond Auch there must be
      hourly and pressing danger of a rescue, I was determined that he who
      should wrest my prisoner from me should pay dearly for it. Only pride,
      and, perhaps, in a degree also, appetite for a fight, had prevented me
      borrowing ten troopers instead of two.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was wont I looked with a lingering eye and many memories at the little
      bridge, the narrow woodland path, the first roofs of the village; all now
      familiar, all seen for the last time. Up the brook a party of soldiers
      were dragging for the captain&rsquo;s body. A furlong farther on, a cottage,
      burned by some carelessness in the night, lay a heap of black ashes. Louis
      ran beside us weeping; the last brown leaves fluttered down in showers.
      And between my eyes and all, the slow steady rain fell and fell. And so I
      left Cocheforet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis went with us to a point a mile beyond the village, and there stood
      and saw us go, cursing me furiously as I passed. Looking back when we had
      ridden on, I still saw him standing, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I
      rode back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen, fool!&rsquo; I said, cutting him short in the midst of his mowing and
      snarling, &lsquo;and give this message to your mistress. Tell her from me that
      it will be with her husband as it was with M. de Regnier, when he fell
      into the hands of his enemy&mdash;no better and no worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to kill her, too, I suppose?&rsquo; he answered glowering at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, fool, I want to save her,&rsquo; I retorted wrathfully. &lsquo;Tell her that,
      just that and no more, and you will see the result.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not,&rsquo; he said sullenly. &lsquo;A message from you indeed!&rsquo; And he spat
      on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then on your head be it,&rsquo; I answered solemnly, And I turned my horse&rsquo;s
      head and galloped fast after the others. But I felt sure that he would
      report what I had said, if it were only out of curiosity; and it would be
      strange if Madame, a gentlewoman of the south, bred among old family
      traditions, did not understand the reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we began our journey; sadly, under dripping trees and a leaden sky.
      The country we had to traverse was the same I had trodden on the last day
      of my march southwards, but the passage of a month had changed the face of
      everything. Green dells, where springs welling out of the chalk had once
      made of the leafy bottom a fairies&rsquo; home, strewn with delicate ferns and
      hung with mosses, were now swamps into which our horses sank to the
      fetlock. Sunny brews, whence I had viewed the champaign and traced my
      forward path, had become bare, wind-swept ridges. The beech woods that had
      glowed with ruddy light were naked now; mere black trunks and rigid arms
      pointing to heaven. An earthy smell filled the air; a hundred paces away a
      wall of mist closed the view. We plodded on sadly up hill and down hill,
      now fording brooks, already stained with flood-water, now crossing barren
      heaths. But up hill or down hill, whatever the outlook, I was never
      permitted to forget that I was the jailor, the ogre, the villain; that I,
      riding behind in my loneliness, was the blight on all&mdash;the
      death-spot. True, I was behind the others&mdash;I escaped their eyes. But
      there was not a line of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s figure that did not speak scorn to
      me; not a turn of head that did not seem to say, &lsquo;Oh, God, that such a
      thing should breathe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only speech with her once during the day, and that was on the last
      ridge before we went down into the valley to climb up again to Auch. The
      rain had ceased; the sun, near its setting, shone faintly; for a few
      moments we stood on the brow and looked southwards while we breathed the
      horses. The mist lay like a pall on the country we had traversed; but
      beyond and above it, gleaming pearl-like in the level rays, the line of
      the mountains stood up like a land of enchantment, soft, radiant,
      wonderful!&mdash;or like one of those castles on the Hill of Glass of
      which the old romances tell us. I forgot for an instant how we were
      placed, and I cried to my neighbour that it was the fairest pageant I had
      ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She&mdash;it was Mademoiselle, and she had taken off her mask&mdash;cast
      one look at me in answer; only one, but it conveyed disgust and loathing
      so unspeakable that scorn beside them would have been a gift. I reined in
      my horse as if she had struck me, and felt myself go first hot and then
      cold under her eyes. Then she looked another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not forget the lesson; and after that I avoided her more
      sedulously than before. We lay that night at Auch, and I gave M. de
      Cocheforet the utmost liberty, even permitting him to go out and return at
      his will. In the morning, believing that on the farther side of Auch we
      ran little risk of attack, I dismissed the two dragoons, and an hour after
      sunrise we set out again. The day was dry and cold, the weather more
      promising. I proposed to go by way of Lectoure, crossing the Garonne at
      Agen; and I thought that, with roads continually improving as we moved
      northwards, we should be able to make good progress before night. My two
      men rode first, I came last by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our way lay down the valley of the Gers, under poplars and by long rows of
      willows, and presently the sun came out and warmed us. Unfortunately the
      rain of the day before had swollen the brooks which crossed our path, and
      we more than once had a difficulty in fording them. Noon found us little
      more than half way to Lectoure, and I was growing each minute more
      impatient when our road, which had for a little while left the river bank,
      dropped down to it again, and I saw before us another crossing, half ford
      half slough. My men tried it gingerly and gave back and tried it again in
      another place; and finally, just as Mademoiselle and her brother came up
      to them, floundered through and sprang slantwise up the farther bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delay had been long enough to bring me, with no good will of my own,
      close upon the Cocheforets. Mademoiselle&rsquo;s horse made a little business of
      the place, and in the result we entered the water almost together; and I
      crossed close on her heels. The bank on either side was steep; while
      crossing we could see neither before nor behind. But at the moment I
      thought nothing of this nor of her delay; and I was following her quite at
      my leisure and picking my way, when the sudden report of a carbine, a
      second report, and a yell of alarm in front thrilled me through.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the instant, while the sound was still in my ears, I saw it all. Like a
      hot iron piercing my brain the truth flashed into my mind. We were
      attacked! We were attacked, and I was here helpless in this pit, this
      trap! The loss of a second while I fumbled here, Mademoiselle&rsquo;s horse
      barring the way, might be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one way. I turned my horse straight at the steep bank, and
      he breasted it. One moment he hung as if he must fall back. Then, with a
      snort of terror and a desperate bound, he topped it, and gained the level,
      trembling and snorting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventy paces away on the road lay one of my men. He had fallen, horse and
      man, and lay still. Near him, with his back against a bank, stood his
      fellow, on foot, pressed by four horsemen, and shouting. As my eye lighted
      on the scene he let fly with a carbine, and dropped one. I clutched a
      pistol from my holster and seized my horse by the head. I might save the
      man yet, I shouted to him to encourage him, and was driving in my spurs to
      second my voice, when a sudden vicious blow, swift and unexpected, struck
      the pistol from my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a snatch at it as it fell, but missed it, and before I could
      recover myself, Mademoiselle thrust her horse furiously against mine, and
      with her riding-whip lashed the sorrel across the ears. As the horse
      reared up madly, I had a glimpse of her eyes flashing hate through her
      mask; of her hand again uplifted; the next moment, I was down in the road,
      ingloriously unhorsed, the sorrel was galloping away, and her horse,
      scared in its turn, was plunging unmanageably a score of paces from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that I think that she would have trampled on me. As it was, I was
      free to rise, and draw, and in a twinkling was running towards the
      fighters. All had happened in a few seconds. My man was still defending
      himself, the smoke of the carbine had scarcely risen. I sprang across a
      fallen tree that intervened, and at the same moment two of the men
      detached themselves and rode to meet me. One, whom I took to be the
      leader, was masked. He came furiously at me to ride me down, but I leaped
      aside nimbly, and, evading him, rushed at the other, and scaring his
      horse, so that he dropped his point, cut him across the shoulder, before
      he could guard himself. He plunged away, cursing and trying to hold in his
      horse, and I turned to meet the masked man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You villain!&rsquo; he cried, riding at me again. This time he manoeuvred his
      horse so skilfully that I was hard put to it to prevent him knocking me
      down; while I could not with all my efforts reach him to hurt him.
      &lsquo;Surrender, will you?&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;you bloodhound!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I wounded him slightly in the knee for answer; before I could do more his
      companion came back, and the two set upon me, slashing at my head so
      furiously and towering above me with so great an advantage that it was all
      I could do to guard it. I was soon glad to fall back against the bank. In
      this sort of conflict my rapier would have been of little use, but
      fortunately I had armed myself before I left Paris with a cut-and-thrust
      sword for the road; and though my mastery of the weapon was not on a par
      with my rapier play, I was able to fend off their cuts, and by an
      occasional prick keep the horses at a distance. Still, they swore and cut
      at me; and it was trying work. A little delay might enable the other man
      to come to their help, or Mademoiselle, for all I knew, might shoot me
      with my own pistol. I was unfeignedly glad when a lucky parade sent the
      masked man&rsquo;s sword flying across the road. On that he pushed his horse
      recklessly at me, spurring it without mercy; but the animal, which I had
      several times touched, reared up instead, and threw him at the very moment
      that I wounded his companion a second time in the arm, and made him give
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was now changed. The man in the mask staggered to his feet, and
      felt stupidly for a pistol. But he could not find one, and he was in no
      state to use it if he had. He reeled helplessly to the bank and leaned
      against it. The man I had wounded was in scarcely better condition. He
      retreated before me, but in a moment, losing courage, let drop his sword,
      and, wheeling round, cantered off, clinging to his pommel. There remained
      only the fellow engaged with my man, and I turned to see how they were
      getting on. They were standing to take breath, so I ran towards them; but
      on seeing me coming, this rascal, too, whipped round his horse and
      disappeared in the wood, and left us victors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I did&mdash;and I remember it to this day with pleasure&mdash;was
      to plunge my hand into my pocket, take out half of all the money I had in
      the world, and press it on the man who had fought for me so stoutly. In my
      joy I could have kissed him! It was not only that I had escaped defeat by
      the skin of my teeth&mdash;and his good sword; but I knew, and felt, and
      thrilled with the knowledge, that the fight had, in a sense, redeemed my
      character. He was wounded in two places, and I had a scratch or two, and
      had lost my horse; and my other poor fellow was dead as a herring. But,
      speaking for myself, I would have spent half the blood in my body to
      purchase the feeling with which I turned back to speak to M. de Cocheforet
      and his sister. Mademoiselle had dismounted, and with her face averted and
      her mask pushed on one side, was openly weeping. Her brother, who had
      faithfully kept his place by the ford from the beginning of the fight to
      the end, met me with raised eyebrows and a peculiar smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Acknowledge my virtue,&rsquo; he said airily. &lsquo;I am here, M. de Berault; which
      is more than can be said of the two gentlemen who have just ridden off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered with a touch of bitterness. &lsquo;I wish that they had not
      shot my poor man before they went.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were my friends,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You must not expect me to blame them.
      But that is not all, M. de Berault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, wiping my sword. &lsquo;There is this gentleman in the mask.&rsquo; And
      I turned to go towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. de Berault!&rsquo; Cocheforet called after me, his tone strained and abrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood. &lsquo;Pardon?&rsquo; I said, turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That gentleman?&rsquo; he said, hesitating and looking at me doubtfully. &lsquo;Have
      you considered what will happen to him if you give him up to the
      authorities?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo; I asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is rather a delicate question,&rsquo; he answered frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for me,&rsquo; I replied brutally, &lsquo;since he is in my power. If he will
      take off his mask I shall know better what I intend to do with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger had lost his hat in his fall, and his fair hair, stained with
      dust, hung in curls on his shoulders. He was a tall man, of a slender,
      handsome presence, and, though his dress was plain and almost rough, I
      espied a splendid jewel on his hand, and fancied that I detected other
      signs of high quality. He still lay against the bank in a half-swooning
      condition, and seemed unconscious of my scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should I know him if he unmasked?&rsquo; I said suddenly, a new idea in my
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would,&rsquo; M. de Cocheforet answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be bad for everyone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho! ho!&rsquo; I replied softly, looking hard first at my old prisoner, and
      then at my new one. &lsquo;Then&mdash;what do you wish me to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave him here!&rsquo; M. de Cocheforet answered, his face flushed, the pulse
      in his cheek beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had known him for a man of perfect honour before, and trusted him. But
      this evident earnest anxiety on behalf of his friend touched me not a
      little. Besides, I knew that I was treading on slippery ground: that it
      behoved me to be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do it,&rsquo; I said after a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &lsquo;He will play me no
      tricks, I suppose? A letter of&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MON DIEU, no! He will understand,&rsquo; Cocheforet answered eagerly. &lsquo;You will
      not repent it. Let us be going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but my horse?&rsquo; I said, somewhat taken aback by this extreme haste.
      &lsquo;How am I to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall overtake it,&rsquo; he assured me. &lsquo;It will have kept the road.
      Lectoure is no more than a league from here, and we can give orders there
      to have these two fetched and buried.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had nothing to gain by demurring, and so, after another word or two, it
      was arranged. We picked up what we had dropped, M. de Cocheforet helped
      his sister to mount, and within five minutes we were gone. Casting a
      glance back from the skirts of the wood I fancied that I saw the masked
      man straighten himself and turn to look after us, but the leaves were
      beginning to intervene, the distance may have cheated me. And yet I was
      not indisposed to think the unknown a trifle more observant, and a little
      less seriously hurt, than he seemed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. AT THE FINGER-POST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through all, it will have been noticed, Mademoiselle had not spoken to me,
      nor said one word, good or bad. She had played her part grimly, had taken
      defeat in silence if with tears, had tried neither prayer nor defence nor
      apology. And the fact that the fight was now over, and the scene left
      behind, made no difference in her conduct. She kept her face studiously
      turned from me, and affected to ignore my presence. I caught my horse
      feeding by the roadside, a furlong forward, and mounted and fell into
      place behind the two, as in the morning. And just as we had plodded on
      then in silence we plodded on now; almost as if nothing had happened;
      while I wondered at the unfathomable ways of women, and marvelled that she
      could take part in such an incident and remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though she strove to hide it, it had made a change in her. Though her
      mask served her well it could not entirely hide her emotions; and
      by-and-by I marked that her head drooped, that she rode listlessly, that
      the lines of her figure were altered. I noticed that she had flung away,
      or furtively dropped, her riding-whip; and I began to understand that, far
      from the fight having set me in my former place, to the old hatred of me
      were now added shame and vexation on her own account; shame that she had
      so lowered herself, even to save her brother, vexation that defeat had
      been her only reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this I saw a sign at Lectoure, where the inn had but one common room
      and we must all dine in company. I secured for them a table by the fire,
      and leaving them standing by it, retired myself to a smaller one near the
      door. There were no other guests; which made the separation between us
      more marked. M. de Cocheforet seemed to feel this. He shrugged his
      shoulders and looked across the room at me with a smile half sad half
      comical. But Mademoiselle was implacable. She had taken off her mask, and
      her face was like stone. Once, only once during the meal, I saw a change
      come over her. She coloured, I suppose at her thoughts, until her face
      flamed from brow to chin. I watched the blush spread and spread; and then
      she slowly and proudly turned her shoulder to me and looked through the
      window at the shabby street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that she and her brother had both built on this attempt, which
      must have been arranged at Auch. For when we went on in the afternoon, I
      marked a change in them. They rode like people resigned to the worst. The
      grey realities of the position, the dreary future began to hang like a
      mist before their eyes, began to tinge the landscape with sadness, robbed
      even the sunset of its colours. With each hour Monsieur&rsquo;s spirits flagged
      and his speech became less frequent; until presently when the light was
      nearly gone and the dusk was round us the brother and sister rode hand in
      hand, silent, gloomy, one at least of them weeping. The cold shadow of the
      Cardinal, of Paris, of the scaffold fell on them, and chilled them. As the
      mountains which they had known all their lives sank and faded behind us,
      and we entered on the wide, low valley of the Garonne, their hopes sank
      and faded also&mdash;sank to the dead level of despair. Surrounded by
      guards, a mark for curious glances, with pride for a companion, M. de
      Cocheforet could have borne himself bravely; doubtless would bear himself
      bravely still when the end came. But almost alone, moving forward through
      the grey evening to a prison, with so many measured days before him, and
      nothing to exhilarate or anger&mdash;in this condition it was little
      wonder if he felt, and betrayed that he felt, the blood run slow in his
      veins; if he thought more of the weeping wife and ruined home which he had
      left behind him than of the cause in which he had spent himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But God knows, they had no monopoly of gloom. I felt almost as sad myself.
      Long before sunset the flush of triumph, the heat of battle, which had
      warmed my heart at noon, were gone, giving place to a chill
      dissatisfaction, a nausea, a despondency such as I have known follow a
      long night at the tables. Hitherto there had been difficulties to be
      overcome, risks to be run, doubts about the end. Now the end was certain
      and very near; so near that it filled all the prospect. One hour of
      triumph I might have, and would have, and I hugged the thought of it as a
      gambler hugs his last stake, planning the place and time and mode, and
      trying to occupy myself wholly with it. But the price? Alas! that too
      would intrude itself, and more frequently as the evening waned; so that as
      I marked this or that thing by the road, which I could recall passing on
      my journey south with thoughts so different, with plans that now seemed so
      very, very old, I asked myself grimly if this were really I; if this were
      Gil de Berault, known at Zaton&rsquo;s, PREMIER JOUEUR, or some Don Quichotte
      from Castille, tilting at windmills and taking barbers&rsquo; bowls for gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached Agen very late that evening, after groping our way through a
      by-road near the river, set with holes and willow-stools and frog-spawn&mdash;a
      place no better than a slough; so that after it the great fires and lights
      at the Blue Maid seemed like a glimpse of a new world, and in a twinkling
      put something of life and spirits into two at least of us. There was queer
      talk round the hearth here, of doings in Paris, of a stir against the
      Cardinal with the Queen-mother at bottom, and of grounded expectations
      that something might this time come of it. But the landlord pooh-poohed
      the idea; and I more than agreed with him. Even M. de Cocheforet, who was
      at first inclined to build on it, gave up hope when he heard that it came
      only by way of Montauban; whence&mdash;since its reduction the year before&mdash;all
      sort of CANARDS against the Cardinal were always on the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They kill him about once a month,&rsquo; our host said with a grin. &lsquo;Sometimes
      it is MONSIEUR is to prove a match for him, sometimes CESAR MONSIEUR&mdash;the
      Duke of Vendome, you understand&mdash;and sometimes the Queen-mother. But
      since M. de Chalais and the Marshal made a mess of it and paid forfeit, I
      pin my faith to his Eminence&mdash;that is his new title, they tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things are quiet round here?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly. Since the Languedoc business came to an end, all goes well,&rsquo; 
      he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle had retired on our arrival, so that her brother and I were
      for an hour or two this evening thrown together. I left him at liberty to
      separate himself from me if he pleased, but he did not use the
      opportunity. A kind of comradeship, rendered piquant by our peculiar
      relations, had begun to spring up between us. He seemed to take an odd
      pleasure in my company, more than once rallied me on my post of jailor,
      would ask humorously if he might do this or that; and once even inquired
      what I should do if he broke his parole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or take it this way,&rsquo; he continued flippantly, &lsquo;Suppose I had struck you
      in the back this evening in that cursed swamp by the river, M. de Berault?
      What then! PARDIEU, I am astonished at myself that I did not do it. I
      could have been in Montauban within twenty-four hours, and found fifty
      hiding-places and no one the wiser.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except your sister,&rsquo; I said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a wry face. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am afraid that I must have stabbed
      her too, to preserve my self-respect. You are right.&rsquo; And he fell into a
      reverie which held him for a few minutes. Then I found him looking at me
      with a kind of frank perplexity that invited question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have fought a great many duels?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever strike a foul blow in one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Why do you ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, because I&mdash;wanted to confirm an impression. To be frank, M. de
      Berault, I seem to see in you two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, two men. One, the man who captured me; the other, the man who let my
      friend go free to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It surprised you that I let him go? That was prudence, M. de Cocheforet,&rsquo; 
      I replied. &lsquo;I am an old gambler. I know when the stakes are too high for
      me. The man who caught a lion in his wolf-pit had no great catch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that is true,&rsquo; he answered smiling, &lsquo;And yet&mdash;I find two men in
      your skin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay that there are two in most men&rsquo;s skins,&rsquo; I answered with a
      sigh. &lsquo;But not always together. Sometimes one is there, and sometimes the
      other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does the one like taking up the other&rsquo;s work?&rsquo; he asked keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders. &lsquo;That is as may be,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You do not take an
      estate without the debts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer for a moment, and I fancied that his thoughts had
      reverted to his own case. But on a sudden he looked at me again. &lsquo;Will you
      answer a question, M. de Berault?&rsquo; he said winningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then tell me&mdash;it is a tale I am sure worth the telling. What was it
      that, in a very evil hour for me, sent you in search of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Lord Cardinal,&rsquo; I answered
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not ask who,&rsquo; he replied drily. &lsquo;I asked, what. You had no grudge
      against me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No knowledge of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what on earth induced you to do it? Heavens! man,&rsquo; he continued
      bluntly, and speaking with greater freedom than he had before used,
      &lsquo;Nature never intended you for a tipstaff. What was it then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose. It was very late, and the room was empty, the fire low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell you&mdash;to-morrow,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I shall have something to say
      to you then, of which that will be part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me in great astonishment, and with a little suspicion. But I
      called for a light, and by going at once to bed, cut short his questions.
      In the morning we did not meet until it was time to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who know the south road to Agen, and how the vineyards rise in
      terraces north of the town, one level of red earth above another, green in
      summer, but in late autumn bare and stony, may remember a particular place
      where the road, two leagues from the town, runs up a steep hill. At the
      top of the hill four roads meet; and there, plain to be seen against the
      sky, is a finger-post indicating which way leads to Bordeaux, and which to
      old tiled Montauban, and which to Perigueux.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hill had impressed me greatly on my journey south; perhaps because I
      had enjoyed from it my first extended view of the Garonne Valley, and had
      there felt myself on the verge of the south country where my mission lay.
      It had taken root in my memory, so that I had come to look upon its bare
      rounded head, with the guide-post and the four roads, as the first outpost
      of Paris, as the first sign of return to the old life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for two days I had been looking forward to seeing it again, That long
      stretch of road would do admirably for something I had in my mind. That
      sign-post, with the roads pointing north, south, east, and west&mdash;could
      there be a better place for meetings and partings?
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to the bottom of the ascent about an hour before noon, M. de
      Cocheforet, Mademoiselle, and I. We had reversed the order of yesterday,
      and I rode ahead; they came after at their leisure. Now, at the foot of
      the hill I stopped, and letting Mademoiselle pass on, detained M. de
      Cocheforet by a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, one moment,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I want to ask a favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me somewhat fretfully; with a gleam of wildness in his eyes
      that betrayed how the iron was, little by little, eating into his heart.
      He had started after breakfast as gaily as a bridegroom, but gradually he
      had sunk below himself; and now he had much ado to curb his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of me?&rsquo; he said bitterly. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to have a few words with Mademoiselle&mdash;alone,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alone?&rsquo; he exclaimed in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied, without blenching, though his face grew dark. &lsquo;For the
      matter of that, you can be within call all the time, if you please. But I
      have a reason for wishing to ride a little way with her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell her something?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you can tell it to me,&rsquo; he retorted suspiciously. &lsquo;Mademoiselle, I
      will answer for it, has no desire to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See me or speak to me? No,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I can understand that. Yet I want to
      speak to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, you can speak in my presence,&rsquo; he answered rudely. &lsquo;If that be
      all, let us ride on and join her.&rsquo; And he made a movement as if to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will not do, M. de Cocheforet,&rsquo; I said firmly, stopping him with my
      hand. &lsquo;Let me beg you to be more complaisant. It is a small thing I ask, a
      very small thing; but I swear to you that if Mademoiselle does not grant
      it, she will repent it all her life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, his face growing darker and darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine words,&rsquo; he said, with a sneer. &lsquo;Yet I fancy I understand them.&rsquo; And
      then with a passionate oath he broke out. &lsquo;But I will not have it! I have
      not been blind, M. de Berault, and I understand. But I will not have it. I
      will have no such Judas bargain made. PARDIEU! do you think I could suffer
      it and show my face again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; I said, restraining myself with difficulty.
      I could have struck the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I know what you mean,&rsquo; he replied, in a tone of suppressed rage. &lsquo;You
      would have her sell herself; sell herself to you to save me. And you would
      have me stand by and see the thing done. No, sir, never; never, though I
      go to the wheel. I will die a gentleman, if I have lived a fool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that you will do the one as certainly as you have done the
      other,&rsquo; I retorted in my exasperation. And yet I admired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am not quite a fool!&rsquo; he cried, scowling at me. &lsquo;I have used my
      eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then be good enough to favour me with your ears!&rsquo; I answered drily. &lsquo;For
      just a moment. And listen when I say that no such bargain has ever crossed
      my mind. You were kind enough to think well of me last night, M. de
      Cocheforet. Why should the mention of Mademoiselle in a moment change your
      opinion? I wish simply to speak to her. I have nothing to ask from her,
      nothing to expect from her, either favour or anything else. What I say she
      will doubtless tell you. CIEL man! what harm can I do to her, in the road
      in your sight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me sullenly, his face still flushed, his eyes suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want to say to her?&rsquo; he asked jealously. He was quite unlike
      himself. His airy nonchalance, his careless gaiety were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what I do not want to say to her, M. de Cocheforet,&rsquo; I answered.
      &lsquo;That should be enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glowered at me a moment, still ill content. Then, without a word, he
      made me a gesture to go to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had halted a score of paces away; wondering, doubtless, what was on
      foot. I rode towards her. She wore her mask, so that I missed the
      expression of her face as I approached; but the manner in which she turned
      her horse&rsquo;s head uncompromisingly towards her brother and looked past me
      was full of meaning. I felt the ground suddenly cut from under me. I
      saluted her, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;will you grant me the privilege of your company
      for a few minutes as we ride?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To what purpose?&rsquo; she answered; surely, in the coldest voice in which a
      woman ever spoke to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I may explain to you a great many things you do not understand,&rsquo; I
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I prefer to be in the dark,&rsquo; she replied. And her manner was more cruel
      than her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I pleaded&mdash;I would not be discouraged&mdash;&lsquo;you
      told me one day, not so long ago, that you would never judge me hastily
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Facts judge you, not I,&rsquo; she answered icily. &lsquo;I am not sufficiently on a
      level with you to be able to judge you&mdash;I thank God.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shivered though the sun was on me, and the hollow where we stood was
      warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still, once before you thought the same,&rsquo; I exclaimed after a pause, &lsquo;and
      afterwards you found that you had been wrong. It may be so again,
      Mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stung me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;It is not impossible. It is you who are impossible. It is
      you who are heartless, Mademoiselle. I have done much in the last three
      days to make things lighter for you, much to make things more easy; now I
      ask you to do something in return which can cost you nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing?&rsquo; she answered slowly&mdash;and she looked at me; and her eyes
      and her voice cut me as if they had been knives. &lsquo;Nothing? Do you think,
      Monsieur, it costs me nothing to lose my self-respect, as I do with every
      word I speak to you? Do you think it costs me nothing to be here when I
      feel every look you cast upon me an insult, every breath I take in your
      presence a contamination? Nothing, Monsieur?&rsquo; she continued with bitter
      irony. &lsquo;Nay, something! But something which I could not hope to make clear
      to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat for a moment confounded, quivering with pain. It had been one thing
      to feel that she hated and scorned me, to know that the trust and
      confidence which she had begun to place in me were transformed to
      loathing. It was another to listen to her hard, pitiless words, to change
      colour under the lash of her gibing tongue. For a moment I could not find
      voice to answer her. Then I pointed to M. de Cocheforet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you love him?&rsquo; I said hoarsely, roughly. The gibing tone had passed
      from her voice to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because if you do you will let me tell my tale. Say no, but once more,
      Mademoiselle&mdash;I am only human&mdash;and I go. And you will repent it
      all your life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had done better had I taken that tone from the beginning. She winced,
      her head dropped, she seemed to grow smaller. All in a moment, as it were,
      her pride collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will hear you,&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then we will ride on, if you please,&rsquo; I said keeping the advantage I had
      gained. &lsquo;You need not fear. Your brother will follow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught hold of her rein and turned her horse, and she suffered it
      without demur; and in a moment we were pacing side by side, with the long
      straight road before us. At the end where it topped the hill, I could see
      the finger-post, two faint black lines against the sky. When we reached
      that&mdash;involuntarily I checked my horse and made it move more slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir?&rsquo; she said impatiently. And her figure shook as with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a tale I desire to tell you, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Perhaps I
      may seem to begin a long way off, but before I end I promise to interest
      you. Two months ago there was living in Paris a man&mdash;perhaps a bad
      man&mdash;at any rate, by common report a hard man; a man with a peculiar
      reputation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on me suddenly, her eyes gleaming through her mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Monsieur, spare me this!&rsquo; she said, quietly scornful. &lsquo;I will take it
      for granted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; I replied steadfastly. &lsquo;Good or bad, he one day, in defiance
      of the Cardinal&rsquo;s edict against duelling, fought with a young Englishman
      behind St Jacques&rsquo; Church. The Englishman had influence, the person of
      whom I speak had none, and an indifferent name; he was arrested, thrown
      into the Chatelet, cast for death, left for days to face death. At last an
      offer was made to him. If he would seek out and deliver up another man, an
      outlaw with a price upon his head, he should himself go free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused and drew a deep breath. Then I continued, looking not at her, but
      into the distance, and speaking slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle, it seems easy now to say what course he should have chosen.
      It seems hard now to find excuses for him. But there was one thing which I
      plead for him. The task he was asked to undertake was a dangerous one. He
      risked, he knew that he must risk, and the event proved him to be right,
      his life against the life of this unknown man. And one thing more; time
      was before him. The outlaw might be taken by another, might be killed,
      might die, might&mdash;But there, Mademoiselle, we know what answer this
      person made. He took the baser course, and on his honour, on his parole,
      with money supplied to him, he went free; free on the condition that he
      delivered up this other man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused again, but I did not dare to look at her; and after a moment of
      silence I resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some portion of the second half of the story you know, Mademoiselle; but
      not all. Suffice it that this man came down to a remote village, and there
      at risk, but, Heaven knows, basely enough, found his way into his victim&rsquo;s
      home. Once there, however, his heart began to fail him. Had he found the
      house garrisoned by men, he might have pressed to his end with little
      remorse. But he found there only two helpless loyal women; and I say again
      that from the first hour of his entrance he sickened at the work which he
      had in hand, the work which ill-fortune had laid upon him. Still he
      pursued it. He had given his word; and if there was one tradition of his
      race which this man had never broken, it was that of fidelity to his side&mdash;to
      the man who paid him. But he pursued it with only half his mind, in great
      misery, if you will believe me; sometimes in agonies of shame. Gradually,
      however, almost against his will, the drama worked itself out before him,
      until he needed only one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Mademoiselle, trembling. But her head was averted: I could
      gather nothing from the outlines of her form; and I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not misunderstand me,&rsquo; I said in a lower voice. &lsquo;Do not misunderstand
      what I am going to say next. This is no love-story; and can have no ending
      such as romancers love to set to their tales. But I am bound to mention,
      Mademoiselle, that this man who had lived almost all his life about inns
      and eating-houses and at the gaming-tables met here for the first time for
      years a good woman, and learned by the light of her loyalty and devotion
      to see what his life had been, and what was the real nature of the work he
      was doing. I think&mdash;nay, I know,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;that it added a
      hundredfold to his misery that when he learned at last the secret he had
      come to surprise, he learned it from her lips, and in such a way that, had
      he felt no shame, Hell could have been no place for him. But in one thing
      I hope she misjudged him. She thought, and had reason to think, that the
      moment he knew her secret he went out, not even closing the door, and used
      it. But the truth was that while her words were still in his ears news
      came to him that others had the secret; and had he not gone out on the
      instant and done what he did, and forestalled them, M. de Cocheforet would
      have been taken, but by others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle broke her long silence so suddenly that her horse sprang
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would to Heaven he had!&rsquo; she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been taken by others?&rsquo; I exclaimed, startled out of my false composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rsquo; she answered with a passionate gesture. &lsquo;Why did you not
      tell me? Why did you not confess to me, sir, even at the last moment? But,
      no more! No more!&rsquo; she continued in a piteous voice; and she tried to urge
      her horse forward. &lsquo;I have heard enough. You are racking my heart, M. de
      Berault. Some day I will ask God to give me strength to forgive you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have not heard me out,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will hear no more,&rsquo; she answered in a voice she vainly strove to render
      steady. &lsquo;To what end? Can I say more than I have said? Or did you think
      that I could forgive you now&mdash;with him behind us going to his death?
      Oh, no, no!&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;Leave me! I implore you to leave me, sir. I
      am not well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She drooped over her horse&rsquo;s neck as she spoke, and began to weep so
      passionately that the tears ran down her cheeks under her mask, and fell
      and sparkled like dew on the mane; while her sobs shook her so that I
      thought she must fall. I stretched out my hand instinctively to give her
      help, but she shrank from me. &lsquo;No!&rsquo; she gasped, between her sobs. &lsquo;Do not
      touch me. There is too much between us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet there must be one thing more between us,&rsquo; I answered firmly. &lsquo;You
      must listen to me a little longer whether you will or no, Mademoiselle:
      for the love you bear to your brother. There is one course still open to
      me by which I may redeem my honour; and it has been in my mind for some
      time back to take that course. &lsquo;To-day, I am thankful to say, I can take
      it cheerfully, if not without regret; with a steadfast heart, if no light
      one. Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I continued earnestly, feeling none of the triumph,
      none of the vanity, none of the elation I had foreseen, but only simple
      joy in the joy I could give her, &lsquo;I thank God that it IS still in my power
      to undo what I have done: that it is still in my power to go back to him
      who sent me, and telling him that I have changed my mind, and will bear my
      own burdens, to pay the penalty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were within a hundred paces of the top and the finger-post. She cried
      out wildly that she did not understand. &lsquo;What is it you&mdash;you&mdash;have
      just said?&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;I cannot hear.&rsquo; And she began to fumble with
      the ribbon of her mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only this, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered gently. &lsquo;I give your brother back
      his word, his parole. From this moment he is free to go whither he
      pleases. Here, where we stand, four roads meet. That to the right goes to
      Montauban, where you have doubtless friends, and can lie hid for a time.
      Or that to the left leads to Bordeaux, where you can take ship if you
      please. And in a word, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I continued, ending a little feebly,
      &lsquo;I hope that your troubles are now over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face to me&mdash;we had both come to a standstill&mdash;and
      plucked at the fastenings of her mask. But her trembling fingers had
      knotted the string, and in a moment she dropped her hand with a cry of
      despair. &lsquo;But you? You?&rsquo; she wailed in a voice so changed that I should
      not have known it for hers. &lsquo;What will you do? I do not understand,
      Monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a third road,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;It leads to Paris. That is my road,
      Mademoiselle. We part here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why?&rsquo; she cried wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because from to-day I would fain begin to be honourable,&rsquo; I answered in a
      low voice. &lsquo;Because I dare not be generous at another&rsquo;s cost. I must go
      back whence I came.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the Chatelet?&rsquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle, to the Chatelet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried feverishly to raise her mask with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not well,&rsquo; she stammered. &lsquo;I cannot breathe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she began to sway so violently in her saddle that I sprang down, and,
      running round her horse&rsquo;s head, was just in time to catch her as she fell.
      She was not quite unconscious then, for as I supported her, she cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not touch me! Do not touch me! You kill me with shame!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she spoke she clung to me; and I made no mistake. Those words made
      me happy. I carried her to the bank, my heart on fire, and laid her
      against it just as M. de Cocheforet rode up. He sprang from his horse, his
      eyes blazing, &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;What have you been saying to her,
      man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will tell you,&rsquo; I answered drily, my composure returning under his
      eye. &lsquo;Amongst other things, that you are free. From this moment, M. de
      Cocheforet, I give you back your parole, and I take my own honour.
      Farewell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He cried out something as I mounted, but I did not stay to heed or answer.
      I dashed the spurs into my horse, and rode away past the cross-roads, past
      the finger-post; away with the level upland stretching before me, dry,
      bare, almost treeless; and behind me, all I loved. Once, when I had gone a
      hundred yards, I looked back and saw him standing upright against the sky,
      staring after me across her body. And again a minute later I looked back.
      This time saw only the slender wooden cross, and below it a dark blurred
      mass.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. ST MARTIN&rsquo;S EVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late evening on the twenty-ninth of November when I rode into Paris
      through the Orleans gate. The wind was in the north-east, and a great
      cloud of vapour hung in the eye of an angry sunset. The air seemed to be
      heavy with smoke, the kennels reeked, my gorge rose at the city&rsquo;s smell;
      and with all my heart I envied the man who had gone out of it by the same
      gate nearly two months before, with his face to the south and the prospect
      of riding day after day and league after league across heath and moor and
      pasture. At least he had had some weeks of life before him, and freedom
      and the open air, and hope and uncertainty; while I came back under doom,
      and in the pall of smoke that hung over the huddle of innumerable roofs
      saw a gloomy shadowing of my own fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For make no mistake. A man in middle life does not strip himself of the
      worldly habit with which experience has clothed him, does not run counter
      to all the hard saws and instances by which he has governed his course so
      long, without shiverings and doubts and horrible misgivings, and struggles
      of heart. At least a dozen times between the Loire and Paris I asked
      myself what honour was, and what good it could do me when I lay rotting
      and forgotten; if I were not a fool following a Jack o&rsquo; Lanthorn; and
      whether, of all the men in the world, the relentless man to whom I was
      returning would not be the first to gibe at my folly?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, shame kept me straight; shame and the memory of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
      looks and words. I dared not be false to her again; I could not, after
      speaking so loftily, fall so low, And therefore&mdash;though not without
      many a secret struggle and quaking&mdash;I came, on the last evening but
      one of November, to the Orleans gate, and rode slowly and sadly through
      the streets by the Luxembourg on my way to the Pont au Change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle had sapped my last strength, however; and with the first
      whiff of the gutters, the first rush of barefooted gamins under my horse&rsquo;s
      hoofs, the first babel of street cries&mdash;the first breath, in a word,
      of Paris&mdash;there came a new temptation; to go for one last night to
      Zaton&rsquo;s, to see the tables again and the faces of surprise, to be for an
      hour or two the old Berault. That would be no breach of honour, for in any
      case I could not reach the Cardinal before to-morrow. And it could do no
      harm. It could make no change in anything. It would not have been a thing
      worth struggling about, indeed; only&mdash;only I had in my inmost heart a
      suspicion that the stoutest resolutions might lose their force in that
      atmosphere; and that there even such a talisman as the memory of a woman&rsquo;s
      looks and words might lose its virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I think that I should have succumbed in the end if I had not
      received at the corner of the Luxembourg a shock which sobered me
      effectually. As I passed the gates, a coach, followed by two outriders,
      swept out of the Palace courtyard; it was going at a great pace, and I
      reined my jaded horse on one side to give it room. By chance as it whirled
      by me, one of the leather curtains flapped back, and I saw for a second by
      the waning light&mdash;the nearer wheels were no more than two feet from
      my boot&mdash;a face inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A face and no more, and that only for a second. But it froze me. It was
      Richelieu&rsquo;s, the Cardinal&rsquo;s; but not as I had been wont to see it&mdash;keen,
      cold, acute, with intellect and indomitable will in every feature. This
      face was contorted with the rage of impatience, was grim with the fever of
      haste, and the fear of death. The eyes burned under the pale brow, the
      moustache bristled, the teeth showed through the beard; I could fancy the
      man crying &lsquo;Faster! Faster!&rsquo; and gnawing his nails in the impotence of
      passion; and I shrank back as if I had been struck. The next moment the
      outriders splashed me, the coach was a hundred paces ahead, and I was left
      chilled and wondering, foreseeing the worst, and no longer in any mood for
      Zaton&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a revelation of such a man was enough to appal me, for a moment
      conscience cried out that he must have heard that Cocheforet had escaped
      him, and through me. But I dismissed the idea as soon as formed. In the
      vast meshes of the Cardinal&rsquo;s schemes Cocheforet could be only a small
      fish; and to account for the face in the coach I needed a cataclysm, a
      catastrophe, a misfortune as far above ordinary mishaps as this man&rsquo;s
      intellect rose above the common run of minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost dark when I crossed the bridges, and crept despondently to
      the Rue Savonnerie. After stabling my horse I took my bag and holsters,
      and climbing the stairs to my old landlord&rsquo;s&mdash;I remember that the
      place had grown, as it seemed to me, strangely mean and small and
      ill-smelling in my absence&mdash;I knocked at the door. It was promptly
      opened by the little tailor himself, who threw up his arms and opened his
      eyes at sight of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Saint Genevieve!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if it is not M. de Berault?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; I said. It touched me a little, after my lonely journey, to find
      him so glad to see me; though I had never done him a greater benefit than
      sometimes to unbend with him and borrow his money. &lsquo;You look surprised,
      little man!&rsquo; I continued, as he made way for me to enter. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be sworn
      that you have been pawning my goods and letting my room, you knave!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Never, your Excellency!&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;On the contrary, I have been
      expecting you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;To-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day or to-morrow,&rsquo; he answered, following me in and closing the door.
      &lsquo;The first thing I said when I heard the news this morning was&mdash;now
      we shall have M. de Berault back again. Your Excellency will pardon the
      children,&rsquo; he continued, bobbing round me, as I took the old seat on the
      three-legged stool before the hearth. &lsquo;The night is cold and there is no
      fire in your room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While he ran to and fro with my cloak and bags, little Gil, to whom I had
      stood at St Sulpice&rsquo;s, borrowing ten crowns the same day, I remember, came
      shyly to play with my sword hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you expected me back when you heard the news, Frison, did you?&rsquo; I
      said, taking the lad on my knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, your Excellency,&rsquo; he answered, peeping into the black pot
      before he lifted it to the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good. Then now let us hear what the news is,&rsquo; I said drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of the Cardinal, M. de Berault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! And what?&rsquo; He looked at me, holding the heavy pot suspended in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not heard?&rsquo; he exclaimed in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a tittle. Tell it me, my good fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not heard that his Eminence is disgraced?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him. &lsquo;Not a word,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set down the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then your Excellency must have made a very long journey indeed,&rsquo; he said
      with conviction. &lsquo;For it has been in the air a week or more, and I thought
      that it had brought you back. A week? A month, I dare say. They whisper
      that it is the old Queen&rsquo;s doing. At any rate, it is certain that they
      have cancelled his commissions and displaced his officers. There are
      rumours of immediate peace with Spain. Everywhere his enemies are lifting
      up their heads; and I hear that he has relays of horses set all the way to
      the coast that he may fly at any moment. For what I know he may be gone
      already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, man&mdash;&rsquo; I said, surprised out of my composure. &lsquo;The King! You
      forget the King. Let the Cardinal once pipe to him and he will dance. And
      they will dance too!&rsquo; I added grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Frison answered eagerly. &lsquo;True, your Excellency, but the King will
      not see him. Three times to-day, as I am told, the Cardinal has driven to
      the Luxembourg and stood like any common man in the ante-chamber, so that
      I hear it was pitiful to see him. But his Majesty would not admit him. And
      when he went away the last time I am told that his face was like death!
      Well, he was a great man, and we may be worse ruled, M. de Berault, saving
      your presence. If the nobles did not like him, he was good to the traders
      and the bourgeoisie, and equal to all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence, man! Silence, and let me think,&rsquo; I said, much excited. And while
      he bustled to and fro, getting my supper, and the firelight played about
      the snug, sorry little room, and the child toyed with his plaything, I
      fell to digesting this great news, and pondering how I stood now and what
      I ought to do. At first sight, I know, it seemed to me that I had nothing
      to do but to sit still. In a few hours the man who had taken my bond would
      be powerless, and I should be free; in a few hours I might smile at him.
      To all appearance the dice had fallen well for me. I had done a great
      thing, run a great risk, won a woman&rsquo;s love; and, after all, I was not to
      pay the penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a word which fell from Frison as he fluttered round me, pouring out
      the broth and cutting the bread, dropped into my mind and spoiled my
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Excellency,&rsquo; he said, confirming something he had stated before
      and which I had missed, &lsquo;and I am told that the last time he came into the
      gallery there was not a man of all the scores who had been at his levee
      last Monday would speak to him. They fell off like rats&mdash;just like
      rats&mdash;until he was left standing alone. And I have seen him!&rsquo;&mdash;Frison
      lifted up his eyes and his hands and drew in his breath&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! I have
      seen the King look shabby beside him! And his eye! I would not like to
      meet it now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pish!&rsquo; I growled. &lsquo;Someone has fooled you. Men are wiser than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So? Well, your Excellency understands,&rsquo; he answered meekly. &lsquo;But&mdash;there
      are no cats on a cold hearth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him again that he was a fool. But for all that, and my reasoning, I
      felt uncomfortable. This was a great man, if ever a great man lived, and
      they were all leaving him; and I&mdash;well, I had no cause to love him.
      But I had taken his money, I had accepted his commission, and I had
      betrayed him. These three things being so, if he fell before I could&mdash;with
      the best will in the world&mdash;set myself right with him, so much the
      better for me. That was my gain&mdash;the fortune of war, the turn of the
      dice. But if I lay hid, and took time for my ally, and being here while he
      still stood, though tottering, waited until he fell, what of my honour
      then? What of the grand words I had said to Mademoiselle at Agen? I should
      be like the recreant in the old romance, who, lying in the ditch while the
      battle raged, came out afterwards and boasted of his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the flesh was weak. A day, twenty-four hours, two days, might make
      the difference between life and death, love and death; and I wavered. But
      at last I settled what I would do. At noon the next day, the time at which
      I should have presented myself if I had not heard this news, at that time
      I would still present myself. Not earlier; I owed myself the chance. Not
      later; that was due to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having so settled it, I thought to rest in peace. But with the first light
      I was awake, and it was all I could do to keep myself quiet until I heard
      Frison stirring. I called to him then to know if there was any news, and
      lay waiting and listening while he went down to the street to learn. It
      seemed an endless time before he came back; an age, when he came back,
      before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he has not set off?&rsquo; I asked at last, unable to control my
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he had not; and at nine o&rsquo;clock I sent Frison out again; and at
      ten and eleven&mdash;always with the same result. I was like a man waiting
      and looking and, above all, listening for a reprieve; and as sick as any
      craven. But when he came back, at eleven, I gave up hope and dressed
      myself carefully. I suppose I had an odd look then, however, for Frison
      stopped me at the door, and asked me, with evident alarm, where I was
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put the little man aside gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the tables,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to make a big throw, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fine morning, sunny, keen, pleasant, when I went out into the
      street; but I scarcely noticed it. All my thoughts were where I was going,
      so that it seemed but a step from my threshold to the Hotel Richelieu; I
      was no sooner gone from the one than I found myself at the other. Now, as
      on a memorable evening when I had crossed the street in a drizzling rain,
      and looked that way with foreboding, there were two or three guards, in
      the Cardinal&rsquo;s livery, loitering in front of the great gates. Coming
      nearer, I found the opposite pavement under the Louvre thronged with
      people, not moving about their business, but standing all silent, all
      looking across furtively, all with the air of persons who wished to be
      thought passing by. Their silence and their keen looks had in some way an
      air of menace. Looking back after I had turned in towards the gates, I
      found them devouring me with their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And certainly they had little else to look at. In the courtyard, where,
      some mornings, when the Court was in Paris, I had seen a score of coaches
      waiting and thrice as many servants, were now emptiness and sunshine and
      stillness. The officer on guard, twirling his moustachios, looked at me in
      wonder as I passed him; the lackeys lounging in the portico, and all too
      much taken up with whispering to make a pretence of being of service,
      grinned at my appearance. But that which happened when I had mounted the
      stairs and came to the door of the ante-chamber outdid all. The man on
      guard would have opened the door, but when I went to enter, a major-domo
      who was standing by, muttering with two or three of his kind, hastened
      forward and stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your business, Monsieur, if you please?&rsquo; he said inquisitively; while I
      wondered why he and the others looked at me so strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am M. de Berault,&rsquo; I answered sharply. &lsquo;I have the entree.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed politely enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, M. de Berault, I have the honour to know your face,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But&mdash;pardon
      me. Have you business with his Eminence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the common business,&rsquo; I answered sharply. &lsquo;By which many of us
      live, sirrah! To wait on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But&mdash;by appointment, Monsieur?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, astonished. &lsquo;It is the usual hour. For the matter of that,
      however, I have business with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man still looked at me for a moment in seeming embarrassment. Then he
      stood aside and signed to the door-keeper to open the door. I passed in,
      uncovering; with an assured face and steadfast mien, ready to meet all
      eyes. In a moment, on the threshold, the mystery was explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. ST MARTIN&rsquo;S SUMMER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes, at the great Cardinal&rsquo;s levee I was the only client! I stared round
      the room, a long, narrow gallery, through which it was his custom to walk
      every morning, after receiving his more important visitors. I stared, I
      say, from side to side, in a state of stupefaction. The seats against
      either wall were empty, the recesses of the windows empty too. The hat
      sculptured and painted here and there, the staring R, the blazoned arms
      looked down on a vacant floor. Only on a little stool by the farther door,
      sat a quiet-faced man in black, who read, or pretended to read, in a
      little book, and never looked up. One of those men, blind, deaf,
      secretive, who fatten in the shadow of the great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, while I stood confounded and full of shamed thought&mdash;for I
      had seen the ante-chamber of Richelieu&rsquo;s old hotel so crowded that he
      could not walk through it&mdash;this man closed his book, rose and came
      noiselessly towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. de Berault?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His Eminence awaits you. Be good enough to follow me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so, in a deeper stupor than before. For how could the Cardinal know
      that I was here? How could he have known when he gave the order? But I had
      short time to think of these things, or others. We passed through two
      rooms, in one of which some secretaries were writing, we stopped at a
      third door. Over all brooded a silence which could be felt. The usher
      knocked, opened, and, with his finger on his lip, pushed aside a curtain
      and signed to me to enter. I did so and found myself behind a screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that M. de Berault?&rsquo; asked a thin, high-pitched voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Monseigneur,&rsquo; I answered trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come, my friend, and talk to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I went round the screen, and I know not how it was, the watching crowd
      outside, the vacant ante-chamber in which I had stood, the stillness and
      silence all seemed to be concentrated here, and to give to the man I saw
      before me a dignity which he had never possessed for me when the world
      passed through his doors, and the proudest fawned on him for a smile. He
      sat in a great chair on the farther side of the hearth, a little red
      skull-cap on his head, his fine hands lying still in his lap. The collar
      of lawn which fell over his cape was quite plain, but the skirts of his
      red robe were covered with rich lace, and the order of the Holy Ghost, a
      white dove on a gold cross, shone on his breast. Among the multitudinous
      papers on the great table near him I saw a sword and pistols; and some
      tapestry that covered a little table behind him failed to hide a pair of
      spurred riding-boots. But as I advanced he looked towards me with the
      utmost composure; with a face mild and almost benign, in which I strove in
      vain to read the traces of last night&rsquo;s passion. So that it flashed across
      me that if this man really stood (and afterwards I knew that he did) on
      the thin razor-edge between life and death, between the supreme of earthly
      power, lord of France and arbiter of Europe, and the nothingness of the
      clod, he justified his fame. He gave weaker natures no room for triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought was no sooner entertained than it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so you are back at last, M. de Berault,&rsquo; he said gently. &lsquo;I have been
      expecting to see you since nine this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Eminence knew, then&mdash;&rsquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you returned to Paris by the Orleans gate last evening alone?&rsquo; he
      answered, fitting together the ends of his fingers, and looking at me over
      them with inscrutable eyes. &lsquo;Yes, I knew all that last night. And now, of
      your business. You have been faithful and diligent, I am sure. Where is
      he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him and was dumb. In some way the strange things I had seen
      since I had left my lodgings, the surprises I had found awaiting me here,
      had driven my own fortunes, my own peril, out of my head&mdash;until this
      moment. Now, at this question, all returned with a rush, and I remembered
      where I stood. My heart heaved suddenly in my breast. I strove for a
      savour of the old hardihood, but for the moment I could not find a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said lightly, a faint smile lifting his moustache. &lsquo;You do not
      speak. You left Auch with him on the twenty-fourth, M. de Berault. So much
      I know. And you reached Paris without him last night. He has not given you
      the slip?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Monseigneur,&rsquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! that is good,&rsquo; he answered, sinking back again in his chair. &lsquo;For the
      moment&mdash;but I knew that I could depend on you. And now where is he?
      What have you done with him? He knows much, and the sooner I know it the
      better. Are your people bringing him, M. de Berault?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Monseigneur,&rsquo; I stammered, with dry lips. His very good-humour, his
      benignity, appalled me. I knew how terrible would be the change, how
      fearful his rage, when I should tell him the truth. And yet that I, Gil de
      Berault, should tremble before any man! With that thought I spurred
      myself, as it were, to the task. &lsquo;No, your Eminence,&rsquo; I said, with the
      energy of despair. &lsquo;I have not brought him, because I have set him free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you have&mdash;WHAT?&rsquo; he exclaimed. He leaned forward as he
      spoke, his hands on the arm of the chair; and his eyes growing each
      instant smaller, seemed to read my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I have let him go,&rsquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why?&rsquo; he said, in a voice like the rasping of a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I took him unfairly,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, Monseigneur, I am a gentleman, and this task should have been
      given to one who was not. I took him, if you must know,&rsquo; I continued
      impatiently&mdash;the fence once crossed I was growing bolder&mdash;&lsquo;by
      dogging a woman&rsquo;s steps and winning her confidence and betraying it. And
      whatever I have done ill in my life&mdash;of which you were good enough to
      throw something in my teeth when I was last here&mdash;I have never done
      that, and I will not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so you set him free?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After you had brought him to Auch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, in point of fact, saved him from falling into the hands of the
      Commandant at Auch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered desperately to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, what of the trust I placed in you, sirrah?&rsquo; he rejoined, in a
      terrible voice; and stooping still farther forward he probed me with his
      eyes. &lsquo;You who prate of trust and confidence, who received your life on
      parole, and but for your promise to me would have been carrion this month
      past, answer me that? What of the trust I placed in you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The answer is simple,&rsquo; I said, shrugging my shoulders with a touch of my
      old self. &lsquo;I am here to pay the penalty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you think that I do not know why?&rsquo; he retorted, striking one hand
      on the arm of his chair with a force that startled me. &lsquo;Because you have
      heard, sir, that my power is gone! Because you have heard that I, who was
      yesterday the King&rsquo;s right hand, am to-day dried up, withered and
      paralysed! Because you have heard&mdash;but have a care! have a care!&rsquo; he
      continued with extraordinary vehemence, and in a voice like a dog&rsquo;s snarl.
      &lsquo;You and those others! Have a care, I say, or you may find yourselves
      mistaken yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As Heaven shall judge me,&rsquo; I answered solemnly, &lsquo;that is not true. Until
      I reached Paris last night I knew nothing of this report. I came here with
      a single mind, to redeem my honour by placing again in your Eminence&rsquo;s
      hands that which you gave me on trust, and here I do place it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he remained in the same attitude, staring at me fixedly. Then
      his face relaxed somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be good enough to ring that bell,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood on a table near me. I rang it, and a velvet-footed man in black
      came in, and gliding up to the Cardinal, placed a paper in his hand. The
      Cardinal looked at it; while the man stood with his head obsequiously
      bent, and my heart beat furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; his Eminence said, after a pause which seemed to me to be
      endless, &lsquo;Let the doors be thrown open.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed low, and retired behind the screen. I heard a little bell
      ring somewhere in the silence, and in a moment the Cardinal stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow me!&rsquo; he said, with a strange flash of his keen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished, I stood aside while he passed to the screen; then I followed
      him. Outside the first door, which stood open, we found eight or nine
      persons&mdash;pages, a monk, the major-domo, and several guards waiting
      like mutes. These signed to me to precede them and fell in behind us, and
      in that order we passed through the first room and the second, where the
      clerks stood with bent heads to receive us. The last door, the door of the
      ante-chamber, flew open as we approached, voices cried, &lsquo;Room! Room for
      his Eminence!&rsquo; we passed through two lines of bowing lackeys, and entered&mdash;an
      empty chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ushers did not know how to look at one another; the lackeys trembled
      in their shoes. But the Cardinal walked on, apparently unmoved, until he
      had passed slowly half the length of the chamber. Then he turned himself
      about, looking first to one side and then to the other, with a low laugh
      of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; he said in his thin voice, &lsquo;what does the Psalmist say? &ldquo;I am
      become like a pelican in the wilderness and like an owl that is in the
      desert!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk mumbled assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And later in the same psalm, is it not written, &ldquo;They shall perish, but
      thou shalt endure?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so,&rsquo; the father answered. &lsquo;Amen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doubtless though, that refers to another life,&rsquo; the Cardinal said, with
      his slow wintry smile. &lsquo;In the meantime we will go back to our books, and
      serve God and the King in small things if not in great. Come, father, this
      is no longer a place for us. VANITAS VANITATUM OMNIA VANITAS! We will
      retire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as solemnly as we had come we marched back through the first and
      second and third doors until we stood again in the silence of the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s chamber&mdash;he and I and the velvet-footed man in black. For
      a while Richelieu seemed to forget me. He stood brooding on the hearth,
      his eyes on a small fire, which burned there though the weather was warm.
      Once I heard him laugh, and twice he uttered in a tone of bitter mockery
      the words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fools! Fools! Fools!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he looked up, saw me, and started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I had forgotten you. Well, you are fortunate, M. de
      Berault. Yesterday I had a hundred clients; to-day I have only one, and I
      cannot afford to hang him. But for your liberty that is another matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have said something, pleaded something; but he turned abruptly to
      the table, and sitting down wrote a few lines on a piece of paper. Then he
      rang his bell, while I stood waiting and confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in black came from behind the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this letter and that gentleman to the upper guard-room,&rsquo; the
      Cardinal said sharply. &lsquo;I can hear no more,&rsquo; he continued, frowning and
      raising his hand to forbid interruption. &lsquo;The matter is ended, M. de
      Berault. Be thankful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment I was outside the door, my head in a whirl, my heart divided
      between gratitude and resentment. I would fain have stood to consider my
      position; but I had no time. Obeying a gesture, I followed my guide along
      several passages, and everywhere found the same silence, the same monastic
      stillness. At length, while I was dolefully considering whether the
      Bastille or the Chatelet would be my fate, he stopped at a door, thrust
      the letter into my hands, and lifting the latch, signed to me to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went in in amazement, and stopped in confusion. Before me, alone, just
      risen from a chair, with her face one moment pale, the next crimson with
      blushes, stood Mademoiselle de Cocheforet. I cried out her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. de Berault,&rsquo; she said, trembling. &lsquo;You did not expect to see me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I expected to see no one so little, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I answered, striving
      to recover my composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you might have thought that we should not utterly desert you,&rsquo; she
      replied, with a reproachful humility which went to my heart. &lsquo;We should
      have been base indeed, if we had not made some attempt to save you. I
      thank Heaven, M. de Berault, that it has so far succeeded that that
      strange man has promised me your life. You have seen him?&rsquo; she continued
      eagerly and in another tone, while her eyes grew on a sudden large with
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I have seen him, and it is true, He has
      given me my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And sent me into imprisonment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For how long?&rsquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;I fear during the King&rsquo;s pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may have done more harm than good,&rsquo; she murmured, looking at me
      piteously. &lsquo;But I did it for the best. I told him all, and perhaps I did
      harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But to hear her accuse herself thus, when she had made this long and
      lonely journey to save me, when she had forced herself into her enemy&rsquo;s
      presence, and had, as I was sure she had, abased herself for me, was more
      than I could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Mademoiselle, hush!&rsquo; I said, almost roughly. &lsquo;You hurt me. You have
      made me happy; and yet I wish that you were not here, where, I fear, you
      have few friends, but back at Cocheforet. You have done more for me than I
      expected, and a hundred times more than I deserved. But it must end here.
      I was a ruined man before this happened, before I ever saw you. I am no
      worse now, but I am still that; and I would not have your name pinned to
      mine on Paris lips. Therefore, good-bye. God forbid I should say more to
      you, or let you stay where foul tongues would soon malign you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me in a kind of wonder; then, with a growing smile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is too late,&rsquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too late?&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;How, Mademoiselle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because&mdash;do you remember, M. de Berault, what you told me of your
      love-story under the guide-post by Agen? That it could have no happy
      ending? For the same reason I was not ashamed to tell mine to the
      Cardinal. By this time it is common property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her as she stood facing me. Her eyes shone under the lashes
      that almost hid them. Her figure drooped, and yet a smile trembled on her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you tell him, Mademoiselle?&rsquo; I whispered, my breath coming
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I loved,&rsquo; she answered boldly, raising her clear eyes to mine. &lsquo;And
      therefore that I was not ashamed to beg&mdash;even on my knees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I fell on mine, and caught her hand before the last word passed her lips.
      For the moment I forgot King and Cardinal, prison and the future, all; all
      except that this woman, so pure and so beautiful, so far above me in all
      things, loved me. For the moment, I say. Then I remembered myself. I stood
      up, and stood back from her in a sudden revulsion of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not know me!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;You do not know what I have done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is what I do know,&rsquo; she answered, looking at me with a wondrous
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but you do not!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;And besides, there is this&mdash;this
      between us.&rsquo; And I picked up the Cardinal&rsquo;s letter. It had fallen on the
      floor. She turned a shade paler. Then she cried quickly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open it! open it! It is not sealed nor closed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed mechanically, dreading with a horrible dread what I might see.
      Even when I had it open I looked at the finely scrawled characters with
      eyes askance. But at last I made it out. And it ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THE KING&rsquo;S PLEASURE IS THAT M. GIL DE BERAULT, HAVING MIXED HIMSELF UP IN
      AFFAIRS OF STATE, RETIRE FORTHWITH TO THE DEMESNE OF COCHEFORET, AND
      CONFINE HIMSELF WITHIN ITS LIMITS UNTIL THE KING&rsquo;S PLEASURE BE FURTHER
      KNOWN.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THE CARDINAL DE RICHELIEU.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were married next day, and a fortnight later were at Cocheforet, in the
      brown woods under the southern mountains; while the great Cardinal, once
      more triumphant over his enemies, saw with cold, smiling eyes the world
      pass through his chamber. The flood tide of his prosperity lasted thirteen
      years from that time, and ceased only with his death. For the world had
      learned its lesson; to this hour they call that day, which saw me stand
      alone for all his friends, &lsquo;The Day of Dupes.&rsquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
